This compensation shall be effective from the moment the Parties agree to it until the Party complained against complies.<br>If the disputing Parties:<br>(a) are unable to agree on compensation within days after the period for developing such compensation has begun; or<br>(b) have agreed on compensation and the complaining Party considers that the other Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement,<br>the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application, to that Party, of benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend. The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits days after the date on which it provides written notice under this paragraph, or days after the Panel issues its determination under paragraph as the case may be, and until the Party complained against complies.<br>If the Party complained against considers that:<br>(a) the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive; or<br>(b) it has complied,<br>it may, within days after the complaining Party provides notice under paragraph request that the original Panel be reconvened to consider the matter.

If the Panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.<br>The complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the Panel has determined under paragraph or, if the Panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph unless the Panel has determined that the Party complained against has complied.<br>In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to paragraph (a) a complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure or other matter that the Panel has found to be inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement; and<br>(b) a complaining Party that considers it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors may suspend benefits in other sectors.<br>Article Compliance Review<br>In those cases where suspension of benefits has been applied, and the Party complained against considers that it has complied, it may provide written notice to the complaining Party to request the end of the suspension of benefits. If the complaining Party disagrees, the Party complained against may refer the matter to the Panel.
