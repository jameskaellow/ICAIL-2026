The mere introduction of new<br>taxation measures or the imposition of taxes in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment,<br>does not in and of itself constitute expropriation;<br>taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognised tax policies, principles and<br>practices do not constitute expropriation.
