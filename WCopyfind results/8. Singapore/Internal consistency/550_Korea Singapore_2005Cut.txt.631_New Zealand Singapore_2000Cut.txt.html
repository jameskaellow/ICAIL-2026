The mere introduction of new<br>taxation measures or the imposition of taxes in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment,<br>does not in and of itself constitute expropriation;<br>taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognised tax policies, principles and<br>practices do not constitute expropriation. In particular, taxation measures aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes should not, generally, be considered to be expropriatory; and<br>taxation measures which are applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to being targeted<br>at investors of a particular nationality or specific individual taxpayers, are less likely to constitute expropriation. A taxation measure should not constitute expropriation if, when the investment is made, it<br>was already in force, and information about the measure was made public or otherwise made publicly<br>available.<br>for Singapore, Director for Fiscal Policy, Ministry of Finance, or his successor or such other public officer as may be designated by Singapore; and<br>for Korea, Deputy Minister, Tax and Customs Office, Ministry of Finance and Economy or his successor.<br>CHAPTER ADMINISTRATION AND FINAL PROVISIONS<br>ARTICLE REVIEW ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT<br><a name='221' href='631_New Zealand Singapore_2000Cut.txt.550_Korea Singapore_2005Cut.txt.html#221'><font color='#FF0000'>In addition to the provisions for consultations elsewhere in this Agreement,<br>Ministers in charge of trade negotiations of the Parties </font></a>or their designated officials <a name='185' href='631_New Zealand Singapore_2000Cut.txt.550_Korea Singapore_2005Cut.txt.html#185'><font color='#FF0000'>shall meet within a year of </font></a><a name='114' href='631_New Zealand Singapore_2000Cut.txt.550_Korea Singapore_2005Cut.txt.html#114'><font color='#FF0000'>the date of entry into force of this Agreement </font></a>and then annually <a name='337' href='631_New Zealand Singapore_2000Cut.txt.550_Korea Singapore_2005Cut.txt.html#337'><font color='#FF0000'>or otherwise as appropriate to review the </font></a>implementation of this Agreement.<br>Pursuant to paragraph the Parties may:<br>review the implementation and application of the provisions of this Agreement including the work of any committees and working groups established under this Agreement;<br>establish and delegate responsibilities to any ad hoc or standing committees, working groups or expert groups to:<br>assign them with tasks on specific matters;<br>study and recommend to the Ministers in charge of trade negotiations of the Parties any appropriate measures to resolve any issues arising from the implementation or application of any part of this Agreement;<br>or<br>to consider, upon either Party's request, new issues not already dealt with by this Agreement;<br>modify the established rules of origin and such modification shall come into force in accordance with Article and<br>consider any other matter that may affect the operation of this Agreement.
