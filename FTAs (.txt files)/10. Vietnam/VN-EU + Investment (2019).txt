(b) carrying out the subsequent verification of the proof of origin and
providing the results of that verification to the other Party; and

(c) granting authorisation to the importing Party to conduct enquiry visits in
order to determine the authenticity of documents or accuracy of
information relevant to the granting of the preferential treatment in
question.

3. Where, in accordance with the provisions on administrative cooperation
or mutual administrative assistance in customs and related matters referred to
in paragraph 2, the importing Party establishes that a proof of origin was
unduly issued by the exporting Party because the requirements provided for in
Protocol 1 (Concerning the Definition of the Concept of "Originating
Products" and Methods of Administrative Cooperation) were not fulfilled, that
importing Party may deny a preferential tariff treatment to a declarant who
claimed it with regard to goods for which the proof of origin was issued.

4. If the importing Party considers that the denial of preferential tariff
treatment for individual consignments referred to in paragraph 3 is insufficient
to implement and control the preferential tariff treatment of a given product,
that Party may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 5,
temporarily suspend the relevant preferential tariff treatment of the products
concerned in the following cases:

(a) when that Party finds that there has been a systematic customs violation
regarding claims for preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement; or

EU/VN/en 13

(b) when that Party finds that the exporting Party has systematically failed to
comply with the obligations under paragraph 2.

5. The competent authority of the importing Party shall, without undue
delay, notify its finding to the competent authority of the exporting Party,
provide verifiable information upon which the finding was based and engage
in consultations with the competent authority of the exporting Party with a
view to achieving a mutually acceptable solution.

6. If the competent authorities have not achieved a mutually acceptable
solution after 30 days following the notification referred to in paragraph 5, the
importing Party shall, without undue delay, refer the matter to the Trade
Committee.

7. If the Trade Committee has failed to agree on an acceptable solution
within 60 days following the referral, the importing Party may temporarily
suspend the preferential tariff treatment for the products concerned.

The importing Party may apply the temporary suspension of preferential tariff
treatment under this paragraph only for a period necessary to protect its
financial interests and until the exporting Party provides convincing evidence
of its ability to comply with the obligations referred to in paragraph 2 and to
provide sufficient control of the fulfilment of those obligations.

The temporary suspension shall not exceed a period of three months. If the
conditions that gave rise to the initial suspension persist after the expiry of the
three-month period, the importing Party may decide to renew the suspension
for another period of three months. Any suspension shall be subject to periodic
consultations within the Trade Committee.

8. The importing Party shall publish, in accordance with its internal
procedures, notices to importers of any notification and decision concerning
the temporary suspension referred to in paragraph 4. The importing Party
shall, without undue delay, notify the exporting Party and the Trade
Committee of any such notification or decision.

agricultural goods. To that end, they shall work together with the aim of
enhancing multilateral disciplines on agricultural exporting state enterprises,
international food aid and export financing support.

2. Upon the entry into force of this Agreement, the exporting Party shall not
introduce or maintain any export subsidies or other measures having

to the domestic industry. The duration of any provisional measure shall not
exceed 200 days, during which time the Party shall comply with the

measure may suspend the application of concessions, with respect to
originating goods of the Party applying the bilateral safeguard measure, which

EU/VN/en 33

have trade effects substantially equivalent to the bilateral safeguard measure.
The obligation to provide compensation, incumbent on the Party applying the
bilateral safeguard measure, and the other Party's right to suspend concessions
under this paragraph shall terminate on the same date as the bilateral safeguard
measure terminates.

identify any substantial deviation from the relevant international
standards and explain the reasons why those standards have been judged
inappropriate or ineffective for the objective pursued;

reviewing, without prejudice to Article 2.3 of the TBT Agreement,
technical regulations with a view to increasing their convergence with
relevant international standards. In undertaking this review, the Parties
shall, inter alia, take into account any new development in the relevant
international standards and whether the circumstances that have given
rise to divergences from any relevant international standard continue to
exist;

specifying technical regulations based on product performance
requirements, rather than on design or descriptive characteristics.

In accordance with Article 2.7 of the TBT Agreement, a Party shall give

favourable consideration to accepting as equivalent technical regulations of
the other Party, even if those regulations differ from its own, provided it is

satisfied that those regulations adequately fulfil the objectives of its own
regulations.

3.

A Party that has prepared a technical regulation that it considers to be

equivalent to a technical regulation of the other Party because it has a
compatible objective and product scope may request in writing that the other
Party recognise it as equivalent. That request shall be made in writing and set

EU/VN/en 44

out in detail the reasons why the technical regulations should be considered to
be equivalent, including reasons with respect to product scope. A Party which
does not agree that the technical regulations are equivalent shall provide to the
other Party, upon request, the reasons for its decision.

ARTICLE 5.5
Standards

1. The Parties affirm their obligations under Article 4.1 of the TBT
Agreement to ensure that their standardising bodies accept and comply with
the Code of Good Practice for the Preparation, Adoption and Application of
Standards in Annex 3 to the TBT Agreement. The Parties further affirm their
adherence to the principles set out in Decisions and Recommendations
adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade since 1
January 1995, G/TBT/1/rev.13 of 8 March 2017, including the Decision of the
Committee on Principles for the Development of International Standards,
Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5 and Annex 3 of the
Agreement, referred to in the Annexes to Part 1 of the document.

2. With a view to harmonising standards on as wide a basis as possible, the
Parties shall encourage their standardising bodies as well as the regional
standardising bodies of which they or their standardising bodies are members
to:

(a) participate, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation of
international standards by relevant international standardising bodies;

(b) use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they
develop, except where those international standards would be ineffective
or inappropriate for the fulfilment of the legitimate objectives pursued by
a Party, for instance because of an insufficient level of protection,
fundamental climatic or geographical factors, or fundamental
technological problems;

(c) avoid duplication of, or overlap with, the work of international
standardising bodies;

(d) review national and regional standards not based on relevant international

EU/VN/en 45

standards at regular intervals, with a view to increasing their convergence
with relevant international standards; and

(e) cooperate with the relevant standardisation bodies of the other Party in
international standardisation activities. That cooperation may be
undertaken in international standardising bodies or at regional level.

3. The Parties shall exchange information on:
(a) their use of standards in support of technical regulations;

(b) their standardisation processes, and the extent of their use of international
or regional standards as basis for their national standards; and

(c) cooperation agreements on standardisation implemented by either Party,
including on standardisation issues in international agreements with third
countries, to the extent this is not explicitly prohibited by those
agreements.

4. The Parties recognise that in accordance with Annex | to the TBT
Agreement, compliance with standards is voluntary. When a Party makes
compliance with standards mandatory, through incorporation or referencing in
technical regulations or conformity assessment procedures, Article 5.7
(Transparency) applies.

ARTICLE 5.6
Conformity Assessment Procedures

1. In respect of mandatory conformity assessment procedures the Parties
shall apply paragraph 1 of Article 5.4 (Technical Regulations), mutatis
mutandis, with a view to avoiding unnecessary obstacles to trade and ensuring
transparency and non-discrimination.

2. In line with Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement, when an importing
Party requires positive assurance of conformity with its applicable technical
regulations or standards, its conformity assessment procedures shall neither be
stricter nor applied more strictly than necessary to give that Party adequate
confidence that products conform with its applicable technical regulations or
standards, taking account of the risks non-conformity would create.

EU/VN/en 46

3.

The Parties recognise that a broad range of mechanisms exists to

facilitate the acceptance of the results of conformity assessment procedures
conducted in the territory of the other Party, including:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

4.

the importing Party's reliance on a supplier's declaration of conformity;

agreements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity assessment
procedures with respect to specific technical regulations conducted by
bodies located in the territory of the other Party;

use of accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies located in
the territory of either Party;

government designation of conformity assessment bodies, including
bodies located in the territory of the other Party;

unilateral recognition by a Party of the results of conformity assessment
procedures conducted in the territory of the other Party;

voluntary arrangements between conformity assessment bodies located in
the territory of either Party; and

use of regional and international multilateral recognition agreements and
arrangements to which the Parties are party.

Having regard in particular to the considerations referred to in paragraph

3, the Parties shall:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

intensify their exchange of information on the mechanism referred to in
paragraph 3 and on similar mechanisms with a view to facilitating the
acceptance of conformity assessment results;

exchange information on conformity assessment procedures and, in
particular, on the criteria used to select appropriate conformity
assessment procedures for specific products;

consider a supplier's declaration of conformity as one of the assurances of
conformity with domestic law;

consider arrangements on mutual acceptance of the results of conformity
assessment procedures according to the procedure set out in paragraph 5;

EU/VN/en 47

(e) exchange information on accreditation policy and to consider how to best
make use of international standards for accreditation and of international
agreements involving the Parties' accreditation bodies, for example,
through the mechanisms of the International Laboratory Accreditation
Cooperation and the International Accreditation Forum;

(f) consider joining or, as applicable, to encourage their testing, inspection
and certification bodies to join any operative international agreements or
arrangements for harmonisation or facilitation of acceptance of
conformity assessment results;

(g) ensure that economic operators have a choice amongst conformity
assessment facilities designated by the authorities to perform the tasks
required by domestic law to assure compliance;

(h) endeavour to use accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies;
and

(1) ensure independence of, and absence of conflict of interest between,
accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies.

5. Upon request from a Party, the other Party may decide to enter into
consultations with a view to defining sectoral initiatives regarding the use of
conformity assessment procedures or the facilitation of acceptance of
conformity assessment results that are appropriate for the respective sectors.
The Party making the request should provide relevant information on how the
sectoral initiative would facilitate trade. If the other Party declines that request
it shall, upon request, provide its reasons.

6. The Parties affirm their obligations under Article 5.2.5 of the TBT
Agreement that fees imposed for mandatory conformity assessment of
imported products shall be equitable in relation to any fees chargeable for
assessing the conformity of like products of domestic origin or originating in
any other country, taking into account communication, transportation and
other costs arising from differences between location of facilities of the
applicant and the conformity assessment body.

EU/VN/en 48

ARTICLE 5.7

Transparency

The Parties acknowledge the importance of transparency with regard to the

preparation, adoption and application of standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures. In that regard, the Parties affirm their
transparency obligations under the TBT Agreement. Each Party shall:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

take the other Party's comments into account where a part of the process
of developing a technical regulation is open to public consultation, and
provide, upon request, written responses in a timely manner to the
comments made by the other Party;

ensure that economic operators and other interested persons of the other
Party are allowed to participate in any formal public consultation process
concerning the development of technical regulations, on terms no less
favourable than those accorded to its own legal or natural persons;

further to subparagraph l(a) of Article 5.4 (Technical Regulations), in
cases where impact assessments are carried out, inform the other Party,
upon request, of the outcome of the impact assessment of the proposed
technical regulation;

when making notifications in accordance with Article 2.9.2 or 5.6.2 of
the TBT Agreement:

(i) allow at least a period of 60 days, following the notification, for the
other Party to provide comments in writing to the proposal and,
where practicable, give due consideration to reasonable requests for
extending that period;

(ii) provide the electronic version of the notified text;

(111) provide, in case the notified text is not in one of the official WTO
languages, a detailed and comprehensive description of the content
of the measure in the WTO notification format;

(iv) reply in writing to written comments received from the other Party
on the proposal, no later than the date of publication of the final
technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure; and

EU/VN/en 49

(v) provide information on the adoption and the entry into force of the
notified measure and the adopted final text through an addendum to
the original notification;

(e) allow sufficient time between the publication of technical regulations and
their entry into force for economic operators of the other Party to adapt,
except where urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection
or national security arise or threaten to arise;

(f) ensure that all technical regulations and mandatory conformity
assessment procedures adopted and in force are publicly available on
official websites and free of charge; and

(g) ensure that the enquiry point, established in accordance with Article 10.1
of the TBT Agreement, provides information and answers in one of the
official WTO languages to reasonable enquiries from the other Party or
from interested persons of the other Party on adopted technical
regulations, conformity assessment procedures and standards.

ARTICLE 5.8
Market Surveillance
The Parties shall:
(a) exchange views on market surveillance and enforcement activities;

(b) ensure that market surveillance functions are carried out by the
competent authorities and that no conflicts of interest exist between the
market surveillance function and the conformity assessment function; and

(c) ensure that there are no conflicts of interest between market surveillance
bodies and the economic operators subject to control or supervision.

EU/VN/en 50

ARTICLE 5.9
Marking and Labelling

1. The Parties note that a technical regulation may include or deal
exclusively with marking or labelling requirements. When a Party's technical
regulations contain mandatory marking or labelling requirements, that Party
shall observe the principles of Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, in particular,
that technical regulations shall not be prepared with a view to, or with the
effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade, and that they
shall not be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate
objective.

2. When requiring mandatory marking or labelling of products, a Party
shall:

(a) only require information which is relevant for consumers or users of the
product or which indicates the product's conformity with the mandatory
technical requirements;

(b) not require any prior approval, registration or certification of the labels or
markings of products as a precondition for placing on its market products
that otherwise comply with its mandatory technical requirements, unless
it is necessary in view of the risk of the products to human, animal or
plant health or life, the environment or national security; this
subparagraph is without prejudice to the right of the Party to require prior
approval of the specific information to be provided on the label or
marking in light of the relevant domestic regulations;

(c) in the event that it requires the use of a unique identification number by
economic operators, issue that number to the economic operators of the
other Party without undue delay and on a non-discriminatory basis;

(d) provided it is not misleading, contradictory or confusing in relation to the
information required in the Party importing the goods, permit the
following:

(1) information in other languages in addition to the language required
in the Party importing the goods;

(11) internationally accepted nomenclatures, pictograms, symbols or

EU/VN/en 51

graphics; or

(411) information in addition to that required in the Party importing the
goods;

(e) accept that labelling, including supplementary labelling or corrections to
labelling, take place, where relevant, in authorised premises, such as in
customs or bonded licensed warehouses at the point of import, in the
importing Party prior to the distribution and sale of the product; the Party
may require that the original labelling is not removed;

(f) when it considers that the legitimate objectives under the TBT
Agreement are not compromised, endeavour to accept non-permanent or
detachable labels, or marking or labelling in the accompanying
documentation rather than physically attached to the product.

ARTICLE 5.10
Cooperation and Trade Facilitation

1. The Parties shall strengthen their cooperation in the field of standards,
technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures with a view to
increasing the mutual understanding of their respective systems and to
facilitating trade between them. To that end, they may establish regulatory
dialogues at both horizontal and sectoral levels.

2. The Parties shall aim to identify, develop and promote bilateral initiatives
regarding standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures that are appropriate for particular issues or sectors and which
facilitate trade. Those initiatives may include:

(a) promoting good regulatory practices through regulatory cooperation,
including the exchange of information, experiences and data, with a view
to improving the quality and effectiveness of their standards, technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures and making efficient
use of regulatory resources;

(b) using a risk-based approach to conformity assessment such as relying on
a supplier's declaration of conformity for low-risk products and, where

EU/VN/en 52

appropriate, reducing the complexity of technical regulations, standards
and conformity assessment procedures;

(c) increasing the convergence of their standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures with relevant international standards,
guides or recommendations;

(d) avoiding unnecessary divergence of approach in standards, technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures where no international
standards, guides or recommendations exist;

(e) promoting or enhancing cooperation between the Parties' respective
organisations, public or private, responsible for standardisation,
conformity assessment and metrology;

(f) ensuring efficient interaction and cooperation between regulatory
authorities at regional or international level; and

EU/VN/en 62

ARTICLE 6.10
Equivalence

1. The Parties recognise that the application of equivalence in Article 4 of
the SPS Agreement is an important tool for trade facilitation and has mutual
benefits for both exporting and importing countries.

2. Equivalence can be accepted for a specific SPS measure or SPS measures
related to a certain product or categories of products, or on a systems-wide
basis.

3. The importing Party shall accept the SPS measures and systems of the
exporting Party as equivalent if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates
that its measures achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of SPS
protection. To facilitate a determination of equivalence, the importing Party
shall, upon request, explain the objective of any relevant SPS measures to the
other Party.

4. Within three months of the date of receipt by the importing Party of a
request from the exporting Party, the Parties shall hold consultations in order
to determine the equivalence of SPS measures and systems.

5. The importing Party shall make a determination of equivalence without
undue delay after the exporting Party has demonstrated the equivalence of the
proposed SPS measures and systems.

6. The importing Party shall accelerate the determination of equivalence in
particular in respect of those products which it has historically imported from
the exporting Party.

7. In case of multiple requests from the exporting Party, the Parties shall
agree within the SPS Committee on a time schedule in accordance with which
they shall initiate the process.

8. In accordance with Article 9 of the SPS Agreement, the importing Party
shall give full consideration to the requests by the exporting Party for
technical assistance to facilitate the implementation of this Article. This
assistance may, inter alia, help to identify and implement measures which can
be recognised as equivalent or to otherwise enhance market access.

EU/VN/en 63

9. The consideration by the importing Party of a request from the exporting
Party for recognition of equivalence of its SPS measures with regard to a
specific product shall not be in itself a reason to disrupt or suspend ongoing
imports from that Party of that product. When the importing Party has made
an equivalence determination, the Parties shall formally record it and apply it
without delay to trade between them in the relevant area.

ARTICLE 6.11
Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures

(b) use such registration system or qualification procedure to prevent or
delay the inclusion of suppliers of the other Party on a list of suppliers or
to prevent such suppliers from being considered for a particular
procurement.

4. Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the procuring
entity shall:

(a) include in the notice of intended procurement at least the information
specified in subparagraphs 2(a), 2(b), 2(f), 2(g), 2(j), 2(k) and 2(1) of

for participation in a procurement based on a multi-use list and all required
documents within the time period provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 9.12
(Time Periods), a procuring entity shall examine the request. The procuring
entity shall not exclude the supplier from consideration in respect of the
procurement on the grounds that the procuring entity has insufficient time to
examine the request, unless, in exceptional cases, due to the complexity of the
procurement, the procuring entity is not able to complete the examination of
the request within the time period allowed for the submission of tenders.

Sub-Central Government and other Covered Entities

that:

(a) the notice is published in accordance with paragraph 7 and includes the
information required under paragraph 8, as much of the information
required under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices) as is available, and a
statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement or that only
the suppliers on the multi-use list will receive further notices of
procurement covered by the multi-use list; and

an interest in a given procurement to the procuring entity sufficient
information to permit them to assess their interest in the procurement,
including all remaining information required under paragraph 2 of Article
9.6 (Notices), to the extent such information is available.

14. A procuring entity covered by Section B (Sub-Central Government
Entities) or C (Other Covered Entities) of Annexes 9-A (Coverage of
Government Procurement for the Union) and 9-B (Coverage of Government
Procurement for Viet Nam) may allow a supplier that has applied for inclusion

procurement where there is sufficient time for the procuring entity to examine
whether the supplier satisfies the conditions for participation.

request for participation in a procurement or application for inclusion on a
multi-use list of the procuring entity's decision with respect to the request or
application.

16. Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request for participation in a
procurement or application for inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to
recognise a supplier as qualified, or removes a supplier from a multi-use list,
the procuring entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, on request of the
supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the

EU/VN/en 142

reasons for its decision.

ARTICLE 9.9
Technical Specifications

1. A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical
specification or prescribe any conformity assessment procedure with the
purpose or the effect of creating an unnecessary obstacle to trade between the
Parties.

2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being
procured, a procuring entity shall, where appropriate:

(a) set out the technical specification in terms of performance and functional
requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

(b) base the technical specification on international standards, where they
exist; otherwise, on national technical regulations, recognised national
standards or building codes.

3. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical
specifications, a procuring entity shall indicate that it will consider tenders of
equivalent goods or services that demonstrably fulfil the requirements of the
procurement by including words such as "or equivalent" in the tender
documentation.

4. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require
or refer to a particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design,
type, specific origin, producer or supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently
precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement requirements and
provided that, in such cases, the procuring entity includes words such as "or
equivalent" in the tender documentation.

5. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have
the effect of precluding competition, advice that may be used in the
preparation or adoption of any technical specification for a_ specific
procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the
procurement.

consultations with a view to preparing the procurement, notably for the
development of technical specifications, provided that, where market research
is performed by a supplier in the context of covered procurement, such
procurement is subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

2. For that purpose, procuring entities may seek or accept advice from
independent experts or authorities or from market participants. That advice
may be used in the planning and conduct of the procurement procedure,
provided that it does not have the effect of distorting competition and does not
result in a violation of the principles of non-discrimination and transparency.

ARTICLE 9.11
Tender Documentation

1. A procuring entity shall promptly make available or provide upon request
to suppliers tender documentation that includes all information necessary to
permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders. Unless already
provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall
include a complete description of:

(a) the procurement, including the nature and quantity of the goods or
services to be procured or, where the quantity is not known, the estimated
quantity, and any requirements to be fulfilled, including any technical

except where price is the sole criterion, the relative importance of such
criteria;

(d) where the procuring entity will conduct the procurement by electronic
means, any authentication and encryption requirements or any other
requirements related to the submission of information by electronic
means, provided that there are such requirements;

(e) where the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules,
including identification of the elements of the tender related to the
evaluation criteria, according to which the auction will be conducted;

(f) where there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time and place
for the opening of tenders and, if the domestic legislation of a Party
stipulates that only certain persons are authorised to be present, the
indication of those persons;

(g) any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and any
limitation on the means by which tenders may be submitted, such as
whether on paper or by electronic means; and

(h) any dates for the delivery of goods or the supply of services.

2. In establishing any date for the delivery of goods or the supply of
services being procured, a procuring entity shall take into account, where
appropriate, such factors as the complexity of the procurement, the extent of
subcontracting anticipated and the realistic time required for production, de-
stocking and transport of goods from the point of supply or for supply of
services.

3. The evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or
tender documentation may include, inter alia, price and other cost factors,
quality, technical merit, environmental characteristics and terms of delivery.

4. A procuring entity shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for
relevant information by any interested or participating supplier, provided that
such information does not give that supplier an advantage over other suppliers.

EU/VN/en 145

Modifications

5. If, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the
evaluation criteria or requirements set out in the notice of intended
procurement or tender documentation provided to participating suppliers, or
amends or reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in
writing all such modifications or amended or re-issued notice or tender
documentation:

(a) to all suppliers that are participating at the time of the modification,
amendment or re-issuance, if such suppliers are known to the procuring
entity, or otherwise publish or provide such documents in the same
manner as the original information was made available; and

(b) in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify their initial tenders
and submit amended tenders, as appropriate.

ARTICLE 9.12
Time Periods
General

1. A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs,
provide sufficient time for suppliers to obtain the tender documentation and to
prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking
into account such factors as:

(a) the nature and complexity of the procurement;
(b) the extent of subcontracting anticipated; and

(c) the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from
foreign as well as domestic points where electronic means are not used.

Such time periods, including any extension thereof, shall be the same for all
interested or participating suppliers.

2. A procuring entity that uses selective tendering shall establish that the
final date for the submission of requests for participation shall not, in
principle, be less than 25 days from the date of publication of the notice of
intended procurement. In case of a state of urgency, duly substantiated by the
procuring entity, that renders this time period impracticable, the time period
may be reduced to not less than 10 days.

3. Except as provided for in paragraphs 4, 5 and 7, a procuring entity shall
establish that the final date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than

described in paragraph 5 of Article 9.6 (Notices) at least 40 days and not
more than 12 months in advance of the publication of the notice of
intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement contains:

(ii) the approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests
for participation;

(111) a statement that interested suppliers should express their interest in
the procurement to the procuring entity;

(iv) the address from which documents relating to the procurement may
be obtained; and

(v) as much of the information that is required for the notice of intended
procurement under paragraph 2 of Article 9.6 (Notices), as is
available;

EU/VN/en 147

(b) the procuring entity, for recurring contracts, indicates in an initial notice
of intended procurement that subsequent notices will provide time
periods for tendering based on this paragraph;

(c) the procuring entity procures commercial goods or services; or

in accordance with paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following
circumstances:

(a) the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;

(b) all tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the
date of the publication of the notice of intended procurement; and

(c) the procuring entity accepts tenders by electronic means.

6. The application of paragraph 5, in conjunction with paragraph 4, shall in
no case result in a reduced time period for tendering established in accordance
with paragraph 3 of less than 10 days from the date on which the notice of
intended procurement is published.

7. If a procuring entity covered by Section B (Sub-Central Government
Entities) or C (Other Covered Entities) of Annexes 9-A (Coverage of

between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence of
agreement, the period shall not be less than 10 days.

ARTICLE 9.13
Negotiations

1. With regard to covered procurement, a Party may provide for its
procuring entities to conduct negotiations:

EU/VN/en 148

(a) if the procuring entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in
the notice of intended procurement required under paragraph 2 of Article
9.6 (Notices); or

(b) if it appears from the evaluation that no tender is obviously the most
advantageous in terms of the specific evaluation criteria set out in the
notice of intended procurement or tender documentation.

2. A procuring entity shall:

(a) ensure that any elimination of suppliers participating in negotiations is
carried out in accordance with the evaluation criteria set out in the notice
of intended procurement or tender documentation; and

(b) when negotiations are concluded, provide a common deadline for the
remaining participating suppliers to submit any new or revised tenders.

ARTICLE 9.14
Limited Tendering

1. Provided a procuring entity does not use limited tendering for the
purpose of avoiding competition among suppliers or in a manner that
discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic
suppliers, a procuring entity may use limited tendering and may choose not to
apply Articles 9.6 (Notices), 9.7 (Conditions for Participation), 9.8
(Qualification of Suppliers), 9.10 (Market Consultations), 9.11 (Tender

no reasonable alternative or substitute goods or services exist for any of
the following reasons:

(1) the requirement is for a work of art;
(ii) the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or
(111) an absence of competition for technical reasons;

for additional deliveries by the original supplier of goods or services that
were not included in the initial procurement, if a change of supplier for
such additional goods or services:

(i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as
requirements of interchangeability or interoperability with existing
equipment, software, services or installations procured under the
initial procurement or conditions under original supplier warranties;
and

(ii) would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of
costs for the procuring entity;

insofar as is strictly necessary if, for reasons of extreme urgency brought
about by events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or
services could not be obtained in time by means of an open tendering or
selective tendering;

for goods purchased on a commodity market or exchange;

when a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service
that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular
contract for research, experiment, study or original development; original
development of a prototype or a first good or service may include limited
production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing
and to demonstrate that the good or service 1s suitable for production or
supply in quantity to acceptable quality standards, but does not include
quantity production or supply to establish commercial viability or to

2.

recover research and development costs;

if additional construction services that were not included in the initial
contract but were within the objectives of the original tender
documentation have, due to unforeseeable circumstances, become
necessary to complete the construction services described therein;

for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that
only arise in the very short term in the case of unusual disposals such as
those arising from liquidation, receivership or bankruptcy, but not for
routine purchases from regular suppliers; or

when a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest provided that:

(i) the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with
the principles of this Chapter, in particular relating to the publication
of a notice of intended procurement; and

(ii) the contest is judged by an independent jury with a view to a design
contract being awarded to a winner.

For each contract awarded in accordance with paragraph 1, a procuring

entity shall prepare a report in writing, or maintain a record. The report or
record shall include the name of the procuring entity, the value and kind of

goods or services procured and a statement indicating the circumstances and
conditions described in paragraph 1 that justified the use of limited tendering.

ARTICLE 9.15

Electronic Auctions

Where a procuring entity intends to conduct a covered procurement using an

electronic auction, the procuring entity shall provide each participant, before
commencing the electronic auction, with:

(a)

(b)

procedures that guarantee the fairness and impartiality of the procurement
process, and the confidentiality of tenders.

opportunity to all participating suppliers.

Awarding of Contracts

shall, at the time of opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in
the notices and tender documentation and be submitted by a supplier that
satisfies the conditions for participation.

4. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to
award a contract, it shall award the contract to the supplier that the procuring
entity has determined to be capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract and
that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and tender
documentation, has submitted:

(a) the most advantageous tender; or
(b) where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.

5. Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally
lower than the prices in other tenders submitted, it may verify with the
supplier that it satisfies the conditions for participation and is capable of
fulfilling the terms of the contract.

6. A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a covered procurement or
modify awarded contracts in a manner that circumvents the obligations under
this Chapter.

EU/VN/en 152

ARTICLE 9.17

3. Not later than 30 days after the award of each contract covered by this
Chapter, a procuring entity shall publish a notice in the appropriate paper or
electronic medium listed in Section H (Publication of Procurement
Information) of Annexes 9-A (Coverage of Government Procurement for the
Union) and 9-B (Coverage of Government Procurement for Viet Nam). Where
the procuring entity publishes the notice only in an electronic medium, the

1. On request of the other Party, a Party shall provide promptly any
information necessary to determine whether a procurement was conducted
fairly, impartially and in accordance with this Chapter, including, where
applicable, information on the characteristics and relative advantages of the
successful tender. The other Party shall not disclose it to any supplier, except
after consulting with, and obtaining the agreement of, the Party that provided
the information.

Non-Disclosure of Information

2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including
its procuring entities, shall not provide to any supplier information that could
prejudice legitimate commercial interests of another supplier or that might
prejudice fair competition between suppliers.

EU/VN/en 154

3. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed as requiring a Party, including
its procuring entities, authorities and review bodies, to disclose confidential
information where disclosure:

(a) would impede law enforcement;
(b) might prejudice fair competition between suppliers;

(c) would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular persons,
including the protection of intellectual property; or

(d) would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.

ARTICLE 9.19
Domestic Review

1. Each Party shall maintain, establish or designate at least one impartial
administrative or judicial authority that is independent of its procuring entities
to review, in a non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective manner, a
challenge by a supplier of:

(a) a breach of this Chapter; or

(b) a failure of a procuring entity to comply with a Party's measures
implementing this Chapter, where the supplier does not have a right to
challenge directly a breach of this Chapter under the domestic law of a
Party,

arising in the context of a covered procurement, in which the supplier has, or
has had, an interest. The procedural rules for all challenges shall be in writing
and made generally available.

2. In case of a complaint by a supplier, arising in the context of covered
procurement in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest, that there has
been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1, the Party of the
procuring entity conducting the procurement shall encourage, where
appropriate, the procuring entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the
complaint through consultations. The procuring entity shall accord impartial
and timely consideration to any such complaint in a manner that is not

EU/VN/en 155

prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future procurement or
to its right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial
review procedures. Each Party or its procuring entities shall make information
on such complaint mechanisms generally available.

3. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and
submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than 10 days from the time
when the basis of the challenge became known or reasonably should have
become known to the supplier.

4. Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 1 initially
reviews a challenge, the Party shall ensure that the supplier may lodge an
appeal against the initial decision with an impartial administrative or judicial
authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the
subject of the challenge.

5. Each Party shall ensure that a review body that is not a court shall have
its decision subject to judicial review or have procedures that provide that:

(a) the procuring entity shall respond in writing to the challenge and disclose
all relevant documents to the review body;

(b) the participants in the proceedings (hereinafter referred to as
"participants") shall have the right to be heard prior to a decision of the
review body being made on the challenge;

(c) the participants shall have the right to be represented and accompanied;
(d) the participants shall have access to all proceedings; and

(e) the review body shall make its decisions on a supplier's challenge in a
timely manner, in writing, and shall include an explanation of the
grounds for each decision.

6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain procedures that provide for:

(a) rapid interim measures, pending the resolution of a challenge, to preserve
the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement. Such interim
measures may result in suspension of the procurement process. The
procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the
interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into

EU/VN/en 156

account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just
cause for not acting shall be provided in writing; and

(b) corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, when
a review body has determined that there has been a breach or a failure as
referred to in paragraph 1. The compensation for the damages suffered
may be limited to either the costs reasonably incurred in the preparation
of the tender or in bringing the challenge, or both.

ARTICLE 9.20
Modification and Rectification to Coverage

1. A Party shall notify the other Party in writing of any proposed
modification or rectification to its coverage (hereinafter referred to as
"modification".

2. For any proposed withdrawal of an entity from its coverage in exercise of
its rights on the grounds that government control or influence over it has been
effectively eliminated, the Party proposing the modification (hereinafter
referred to as "modifying Party") shall include in the notification evidence that
such government control or influence has been effectively eliminated.

3. Government control or influence over an entity is deemed to be
effectively eliminated when the modifying Party, including for the Union its
central government entities and its sub-central government entities, and for
Viet Nam its central government entities and sub-central government entities:

(a) does not own directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the entity's
subscribed capital or the votes attached to the shares issued by the entity;
and

(b) cannot appoint directly or indirectly more than half of the members of the
entity's board of directors or an equivalent body.

4. For any other proposed modification, the modifying Party shall include in
the notification information regarding the likely consequences of the change
for the mutually agreed coverage provided in this Agreement. Where the
modifying Party proposes to make rectifications of a purely formal nature and

EU/VN/en 157

minor modifications to its coverage not affecting covered procurement,
modifications of this kind shall be notified at least every two years.

Proposed modifications of coverage are deemed to constitute rectifications of
a purely formal nature and minor modifications to the Party's coverage in the
following cases:

(a) changes in the name of a procuring entity;

(b) merger of one or more procuring entities listed in Annex 9-A (Coverage
of Government Procurement for the Union) or 9-B (Coverage of
Government Procurement for Viet Nam); or

(c) the separation of a procuring entity listed in Annex 9-A (Coverage of
Government Procurement for the Union) or 9-B (Coverage of
Government Procurement for Viet Nam) into two or more entities that
are all added to the procuring entities listed in the same Section of the
Annex.

5. The modifying Party may include in its notice an offer of compensatory
adjustments for the change to its coverage, if necessary to maintain a level of
coverage comparable to that existing prior to the modification. The modifying
Party shall not be required to provide compensatory adjustments to the other
Party when a proposed modification concerns:

(a) a procuring entity over which it has effectively eliminated its control or
influence in respect of covered procurement by that entity; or

(b) rectifications of a purely formal nature and minor modifications to Annex
9-A (Coverage of Government Procurement for the Union) or 9-B
(Coverage of Government Procurement for Viet Nam).

Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), should the withdrawal by a modifying
Party of a significant number of procuring entities from its coverage on the
ground that these entities are no longer under government control or influence
in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 3 result in a significant
imbalance of coverages agreed between the Parties, the modifying Party shall
accept to enter into consultations with the other Party to discuss, without
prejudice, the modalities for redressing such imbalance.

6. The other Party shall notify the modifying Party of any objection to the

EU/VN/en 158

proposed modification within 45 days of the notification.

7. If the other Party notifies an objection, both Parties shall seek to resolve
the issue through consultations. During the consultations, the objecting Party
may request further information with a view to clarifying the proposed
modification, including the nature of any government control or influence.

8. If the consultations under paragraph 7 do not resolve the issue, the Parties
may use the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in Chapter 15
(Dispute Settlement).

9. A proposed modification shall become effective only if:

(a) the other Party has not submitted to the modifying Party a written
objection to the proposed modification within 45 days from the date of
the notification of the proposed modifications;

(b) the Parties have reached an agreement; or

(c) an arbitration panel has issued a final report in accordance with Article
15.11 (Final Report) concluding that the Parties shall give effect to the
proposed modification.

ARTICLE 9.21
Cooperation

1. The Parties recognise their shared interest in cooperating in the
promotion of international liberalisation of government procurement markets
with a view to achieving enhanced understanding of their respective
government procurement systems and to improving access to their respective
markets.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of Article 9.6 (Notices), the Parties
shall endeavour to cooperate in matters such as:

(a) exchanging experiences and information, such as regulatory frameworks
and best practices;

(b) developing and expanding the use of electronic means in government

EU/VN/en 159

procurement systems;

(c) building capability of government officials in best government
procurement practices; and

(d) institutional strengthening for the fulfilment of the provisions of this
Chapter.

ARTICLE 9.22
Future Negotiations
Procurement by Electronic Means

1. The Parties shall review the provisions of Article 9.15 (Electronic
Auctions) once Viet Nam's electronic procurement system has been fully
developed to take into account possible technological changes and in
particular to consider other aspects such as the mathematical formula used for
the automatic evaluation method and the possible communication of the
results of any initial evaluation to the participants in the auction.

2. The Parties shall conduct further negotiations on the duration of the
period for the storage of data relating to procurement by electronic means
once Viet Nam's electronic procurement system is operational.

Market Access

3. The Parties shall conduct further negotiations on the coverage of
additional sub-central government entities no later than 15 years after the date
of the entry into force of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9.23

Committee on Investment, Services, Electronic Commerce and
Government Procurement

CHAPTER 10

COMPETITION POLICY

SECTION A

ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT

ARTICLE 10.1

Principles

The Parties recognise the importance of undistorted competition in their trade
and investment relations. The Parties acknowledge that anti-competitive
conduct has the potential to distort the proper functioning of markets and
undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation.

EU/VN/en 161

ARTICLE 10.2
Legislative Framework

1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain comprehensive legislation on
competition that proscribes anti-competitive conduct, with the objective of
promoting economic efficiency and consumer welfare, and shall take
appropriate action with respect to such conduct.

2. The competition law of the Parties shall, in their respective territories,
effectively address:

(a) agreements between enterprises, decisions by associations of enterprises
and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the
prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;

(b) abuses by one or more enterprises of a dominant position, and
concentrations between enterprises which would significantly impede
effective competition.

ARTICLE 10.3
Implementation

1. Each Party shall maintain its autonomy in developing and enforcing its
competition law.

2. Each Party shall maintain authorities which are responsible for the full
application and the effective enforcement of its competition law and ensure
that they are appropriately equipped and have the powers necessary for
fulfilling their responsibilities.

3. All enterprises, private or public, shall be subject to the competition law
referred to in Article 10.2 (Legislative Framework).

4. Each Party shall apply its competition law in a transparent and non-
discriminatory manner, including to private and public enterprises, respecting

concerned.

EU/VN/en 162

5. The application of competition law shall not obstruct the performance, in
law or in fact, of the particular tasks of public interest assigned to the
enterprises in question. Exemptions from the competition law of a Party shall
be limited to tasks of public interest, proportionate to the desired public policy
objective and transparent.

SECTION B

SUBSIDIES

ARTICLE 10.4
Principles

1. The Parties agree that a Party may grant subsidies when they are
necessary to achieve a public policy objective. The Parties acknowledge that
certain subsidies have the potential to distort the proper functioning of markets
and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation. In principle, a Party should
not grant subsidies to enterprises providing goods or services if they
negatively affect, or are likely to negatively affect, competition and trade.

2. An illustrative list of public policy objectives for which a Party may grant
subsidies, subject to the conditions set out in this Section, includes the
following:

(a) making good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional
occurrences;

(b) promoting the economic development of areas where the standard of
living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;

(c) remedying a serious disturbance in the economy of one of the Parties;

(d) facilitating the development of certain economic activities or of certain
economic areas, including but not limited to, subsidies for clearly defined
research, development and innovation purposes, subsidies for training or
for the creation of employment, subsidies for environmental purposes,
subsidies in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises as defined in

EU/VN/en 163

the Parties' respective legislations; and
(e) promoting culture and heritage conservation.

3. Each Party shall ensure that enterprises use the specific subsidies
provided by a Party only for the policy objective for which the specific
subsidies have been granted.!

ARTICLE 10.5
Definition and Scope

1. For the purposes of this Section, a "subsidy" means a measure which
fulfils the conditions set out in Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement irrespective
of whether it is granted to an enterprise manufacturing goods or supplying
services.”

2. This Section applies only to subsidies which are specific in accordance
with Article 2 of the SCM Agreement. Subsidies to individual consumers or
general measures, including subsidies or measures intended to achieve social
policy objectives, are not considered as specific.

3. This Section applies to specific subsidies to all enterprises, including
public and private enterprises.

4. The application of this Section shall not obstruct the performance, in law
or in fact, of the particular tasks of public interest, including public service
obligations, assigned to the enterprises concerned. Exemptions should be
limited to tasks of public interest, proportionate to the public policy objectives
assigned to those enterprises, and transparent.

5. This Section does not apply to non-economic activities.

6. Paragraph 1 of Article 10.9 (Specific Subsidies Subject to Conditions)

For greater certainty, when a Party has set up the relevant legislative framework and
administrative procedures to this effect, the obligation is considered to be fulfilled.

This Article does not prejudice the Parties' positions and the possible outcome of future
discussions in the WTO on subsidies to services. Depending on the progress of those
discussions at the WTO level, the Parties may adopt a decision by a relevant committee to
update this Agreement in this respect.

ARTICLE 12.18
Rights Conferred by a Trademark

A registered trademark shall confer on the proprietor exclusive rights therein.
The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his
consent from using in the course of trade:

(a) any sign which is identical with the trademark in relation to goods or
services which are identical with those for which the trademark is
registered;” and

(b) any sign which is identical with or similar to the trademark in relation to
goods or services which are identical with or similar to those for which
the trademark is registered, where such use would result in a likelihood
of confusion on the part of the public.

For greater certainty, a Party shall use the updated versions of the Nice Classification to the
extent that the updated version has been published by WIPO and, in the case of Viet Nam, the
official translation has been published.

For greater certainty, this is without prejudice to Article 12.21 (Exceptions to the Rights
Conferred by a Trademark).

EU/VN/en 188

ARTICLE 12.19

applications and an opportunity for the trademark applicant to respond to such
opposition.

3. Each Party shall provide a publicly available electronic database of
published trademark applications and trademark registrations.

ARTICLE 12.20
Well-Known Trademarks

For the purposes of giving effect to protection of well-known trademarks, as
referred to in Article 6bis of the Paris Convention and paragraphs 2 and 3 of
Article 16 of the TRIPS Agreement, the Parties shall give consideration to the
Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-
Known Marks, adopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection
of Industrial Property and the General Assembly of the WIPO at the
Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of
WIPO on 20 to 29 September 1999.

ARTICLE 12.21
Exceptions to the Rights Conferred by a Trademark
Each Party:

(a) shall provide for the fair use of descriptive terms! as a limited exception

The fair use of descriptive terms includes the use of a sign to indicate the geographic origin of
the goods or services, where such use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or
commercial matters.

EU/VN/en 189

to the rights conferred by trademarks; and
(b) may provide for other limited exceptions,

provided that these exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the
owners of the trademarks and of third parties.

ARTICLE 12.22
Revocation of a Registered Trademark’

1. Each Party shall provide that a registered trademark shall be liable to
revocation if, within a continuous period of five years prior to a request for
revocation, it has not been put to genuine? use by its owner or the owner's
licensee in the relevant territory in connection with the goods or services in
respect of which it is registered, without justifiable reasons, except where the
use 1s commenced or resumed at least three months before the request for
revocation. A Party may provide that this exception be disregarded where
preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the
proprietor becomes aware that the request for revocation may be filed.

2. A Party may provide that a trademark can be liable to revocation if, after
the date on which it was registered, it has become, as a result of acts or
inactivity of the proprietor, the common name in the trade for a product or
service in respect of which it is registered.

3. Any use of a registered trademark by the proprietor of the trademark or
with his consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered
that is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or
geographical origin of those goods or services shall make the trademark liable
to revocation or, alternatively, be prohibited by relevant domestic law.

For Viet Nam "revocation" is equivalent to "termination".

Genuine use implies real use for the purpose of trading in the goods or services in question so
as to generate goodwill. In general, this implies actual sales and there must have been some
sales of the goods or providing of the services during the relevant period of time. Use in
advertising may amount to genuine use. However, mere preparatory steps are not to be
regarded as genuine use of a mark. Genuine use is opposed to token or artificial use designed
solely to maintain the trade mark on the register.

consumption in the other Party;

(b) the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good that
indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a
geographical area other than the true place of origin in a manner which
misleads the public as to the geographical origin or nature of the good;

opportunity to comment before the third country's geographical indication
becomes protected.

5. Nothing in this Sub-Section shall oblige a Party to protect a geographical
indication of the other Party which is not, or ceases to be, protected in its
country of origin. Each Party shall notify the other Party if a geographical

shall take place in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 12.63 (Working

EU/VN/en 194

Group on Intellectual Property Rights, including Geographical Indications).

ARTICLE 12.35
Protection of Registered Industrial Designs

1. The Parties shall provide for the protection of independently created

EU/VN/en 198

industrial designs! that are new or original”. This protection shall be provided
by registration and shall confer an exclusive right upon their holders in
accordance with this Sub-Section.3

2. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a
component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and
original:

(a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex
product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and

(b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in
themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.

3. The term "normal use" in subparagraph 2(a) means use by the end user,
excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.

4. The owner of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third

ARTICLE 12.36
Exceptions and Exclusions
1. A Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs,

appearance of the whole product or a separable or inseparable part of product.

The Parties agree that when the domestic law of a Party so provides, individual character of
designs can also be required. This refers to designs that significantly differ from known
designs or combinations of known designs' features. The Union considers designs to have
individual character if the overall impression it produces on the informed users differs from
the overall impression produced on such a user by any design which has been made available
to the public.

It is understood that designs are not excluded from protection simply on the basis that they
constitute a part of an article or product, provided that they are visible, fulfil the criteria of
this paragraph, and:

(a) fulfil any other criteria for design protection; and

(b) are not otherwise excluded from design protection,

in accordance with the Parties' respective domestic law.

ARTICLE 12.45

Provisional Measures

Each Party shall ensure that its competent judicial authorities, upon

request by a party who has presented reasonably available evidence to support

opportunity to submit any observations, issue a decision within 45 days of the receipt of the notice

of challenge and notify forthwith the disputing parties and other Members of the division.

4. Challenges against the appointment of the President of the Tribunal to a division shall be
decided by the President of the Appeal Tribunal and vice versa.

5. | Upon a reasoned recommendation from the President of the Appeal Tribunal, or on their joint
initiative, the Parties may by decision of the Committee decide to remove a Member from the
Tribunal or a Member from the Appeal Tribunal where the behaviour of this Member is inconsistent
with the obligations set out in paragraph 1 and incompatible with his continued membership of the
Tribunal or the Appeal Tribunal. If the President of the Appeal Tribunal is alleged of such
behaviour, the President of the Tribunal shall submit the reasoned recommendation. Paragraph 2 of
Article 3.38 (Tribunal) and paragraph 3 of Article 3.39 (Appeal Tribunal) shall apply

mutatis mutandis for filling vacancies that may arise pursuant to this paragraph.

relating to this Section, the Committee may adopt interpretations of provisions of this Agreement.
Any such interpretation shall be binding upon the Tribunal and the Appeal Tribunal. The

Committee may decide that an interpretation shall have binding effect from a specific date.

EU/VN/IPA/en 84

ARTICLE 3.43

Anti-Circumvention

For greater certainty, the Tribunal shall decline jurisdiction where the dispute had arisen, or was
foreseeable on the basis of a high degree of probability, at the time when the claimant acquired
ownership or control of the investment subject to the dispute and the Tribunal determines, on the
basis of the facts of the case, that the claimant has acquired ownership or control of the investment
for the main purpose of submitting the claim under this Section. The possibility to decline
jurisdiction in such circumstances is without prejudice to other jurisdictional objections which

could be entertained by the Tribunal.
ARTICLE 3.44
Preliminary Objections
1. | The respondent may file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit, no later
than 30 days after the constitution of the division of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 7 of

Article 3.38 (Tribunal), and in any event before the first session of the division of the Tribunal, or

30 days after the respondent became aware of the facts on which the objection is based.

EU/VN/IPA/en 85

2. The respondent shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection.

3. The Tribunal, after giving the disputing parties an opportunity to present their observations on
the objection, shall, at the first meeting of the division of the Tribunal or promptly thereafter, issue a
decision or provisional award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor. If the objection is
received after the first meeting of the division of the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall issue such decision
or provisional award as soon as possible, and no later than 120 days after the objection was filed.
When issuing the decision the Tribunal shall assume the alleged facts to be true, and may also

consider any relevant facts not in dispute.

4. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a disputing party to
object, pursuant to Article 3.45 (Claims Unfounded as a Matter of Law) or in the course of the
proceedings, to the legal merits of a claim and without prejudice to a Tribunal's authority to address
other objections as a preliminary question. For greater certainty, such objection may include an
objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or, for

other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal.

EU/VN/IPA/en 86

ARTICLE 3.45

Claims Unfounded as a Matter of Law

1. | Without prejudice to the Tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary
question, such as an objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal, and without
prejudice to a respondent's right to raise any such objections at any appropriate time, the Tribunal
shall decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a
claim, or any part thereof, submitted under this Section is not a claim for which an award in favour
of the claimant may be made under Article 3.53 (Provisional Award), even if the facts alleged were

assumed to be true. The Tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.

2. | An objection under paragraph 1 shall be submitted to the Tribunal as soon as possible after
the division of the Tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the Tribunal fixes for
the respondent to submit its counter-memorial or statement of defence or, in the case of an
amendment to the claim, the date the Tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the
amendment. This objection shall not be submitted as long as proceedings under

Article 3.44 (Preliminary Objections) are pending, unless the Tribunal grants leave to file an

objection under this Article, after having taken due account of the circumstances of the case.

EU/VN/IPA/en 87

3. Upon receipt of an objection under paragraph 1, and unless it considers the objection
manifestly unfounded, the Tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a
schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for
considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or provisional award on the

objection, stating the grounds therefore.

the disputing party that provided the information clearly designates it as such.!

8. A disputing party may disclose to other persons in connection with proceedings, including
witnesses and experts, such unredacted documents as it considers necessary in the course of
proceedings under this Section. However, the disputing party shall ensure that those persons protect

the confidential or protected information in those documents.

For greater certainty, where a disputing party that submitted the information decides to
withdraw all or parts of its submission containing such information in accordance with
Article 7(4) of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, the other disputing party shall, whenever
necessary, resubmit complete and redacted documents which either remove the information
withdrawn by the disputing party that first submitted the information or redesignate the
information consistent with the designation of the disputing party that first submitted the
information.

EU/VN/IPA/en 90

ARTICLE 3.47

Interim Decisions

The Tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party
or to ensure that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve
evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.

alleged to constitute a breach. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a

recommendation.
ARTICLE 3.48

being able to honour a possible decision on costs issued against the claimant.
2. If the security for costs is not provided in full within 30 days of the Tribunal's order, or within

any other time period set by the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall so inform the disputing parties. The

Tribunal may order the suspension or termination of the proceedings.

EU/VN/IPA/en 91

ARTICLE 3.49

Discontinuance
If the claimant, following the submission of a claim under this Section, fails to take any steps in the
proceedings during 180 consecutive days or such periods as the disputing parties may agree, the
claimant shall be deemed to have withdrawn its claim and to have discontinued the proceedings.
The Tribunal shall, at the request of the respondent and after notice to the disputing parties, take
note of the discontinuance of the proceedings in an order and issue an award on costs. After such an
order has been rendered the authority of the Tribunal shall lapse. The claimant may not
subsequently submit a claim on the same matter.

ARTICLE 3.50

Language of the Proceedings

1. The disputing parties shall agree on the language to be used in the proceedings.

EU/VN/IPA/en 92

of the constitution of the division of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph 7 of Article 3.38 (Tribunal),
the Tribunal shall determine the language to be used in the proceedings. The Tribunal shall make its
determination after consulting the disputing parties with a view to ensuring the economic efficiency
of the proceedings and ensuring that the determination does not impose any unnecessary burden on

the resources of the disputing parties and of the Tribunal.'

ARTICLE 3.51

The Non-Disputing Party

1. | The respondent shall, within 30 days of the receipt of any documents referred in
subparagraphs (a) and (b) or promptly after any dispute concerning confidential or protected

information has been resolved, provide the non-disputing Party:

(a) the request for consultations referred to in Article 3.30 (Consultations), the notice of intent
under paragraph 1 of Article 3.32 (Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim), the determination
under paragraph 2 of Article 3.32 (Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim) and the claim referred
to in Article 3.33 (Submission of a Claim); and

' In considering the economic efficiency of the proceedings, the Tribunal should take into

account the costs of the disputing parties and of the Tribunal in processing case-law and legal
writings which will potentially be submitted by the disputing parties.

EU/VN/IPA/en 93

(b) upon request, any documents that are made available to the public in accordance with

Article 3.46 (Transparency of Proceedings).

2. The non-disputing Party has the right to attend hearings held under this Section and to make
oral representations relating to the interpretation of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3.52
Expert Reports
The Tribunal, at the request of a disputing party or, after consulting the disputing parties, on its own
initiative, may appoint one or more experts to report to it in writing on any factual issue concerning
environmental, health, safety, or other matters raised by a disputing party in the proceedings.
ARTICLE 3.53
Provisional Award
1. Where the Tribunal concludes that a measure in dispute breaches any of the provisions of
Chapter 2 (Investment Protection), the Tribunal may, on the basis of a request from the claimant

and after hearing the disputing parties, award, separately or in combination, only:

(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest; and

EU/VN/IPA/en 94

(b) restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the respondent may pay
monetary damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution, determined in a manner

consistent with the relevant provisions of Chapter 2 (Investment Protection).

Where the claim was submitted on behalf of a locally-established company, any award under this

paragraph shall provide that:

(a) monetary damages and any applicable interest shall be paid to the locally established

company; and
(b) any restitution shall be made to the locally established company.
The Tribunal may not order the repeal of the treatment concerned.
2. Monetary damages shall not be greater than the loss suffered by the claimant or, as applicable,
by its locally established company, as a result of the breach of any of the provisions of
Chapter 2 (Investment Protection), reduced by any prior damages or compensation already provided
by the Party concerned. For greater certainty, when an investor submits a claim on its own behalf,
the investor may recover only loss or damage that the investor has incurred with regards to the

covered investment of that investor.

3. The Tribunal may not award punitive damages.

EU/VN/IPA/en 95

4. The Tribunal shall order that the costs of the proceedings’ be borne by the unsuccessful
disputing party. In exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal may apportion costs between the
disputing parties if it determines that apportionment is appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
Other reasonable costs, including reasonable costs of legal representation and assistance, shall be
borne by the unsuccessful disputing party, unless the Tribunal determines that such apportionment
is unreasonable in the circumstances of the case. Where only some parts of the claims have been
successful the costs shall be adjusted, proportionately, to the number or extent of the successful

parts of the claims. The Appeal Tribunal shall deal with costs in accordance with this Article.

5. | The Committee may adopt supplementing rules on fees for the purposes of determining the
maximum amount of costs of legal representation and assistance that may be borne by specific
categories of unsuccessful disputing parties. Such supplementing rules shall take into account the
financial resources of a claimant who is a natural person or a small or medium-sized enterprise. The
Committee shall endeavour to adopt such supplementing rules no later than one year after the date

of entry into force of this Agreement.

6. The Tribunal shall issue a provisional award within 18 months of the date of submission of
the claim. If that deadline cannot be respected, the Tribunal shall adopt a decision to that effect,

which shall specify the reasons for such delay.

' For greater certainty, the term "costs of the proceedings" includes (a) the reasonable costs of

expert advice and of other assistance required by the Tribunal, and (b) the reasonable travel
and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the Tribunal.

EU/VN/IPA/en 96

ARTICLE 3.54

Appeal Procedure

1. Either disputing party may appeal a provisional award before the Appeal Tribunal, within 90

days of its issuance. The grounds for appeal are:

(a) that the Tribunal has erred in the interpretation or application of the applicable law;

(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly erred in the appreciation of the facts, including the

appreciation of relevant domestic law; or

(c) those provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, in so far as they are not covered by
subparagraphs (a) and (b).

2. The Appeal Tribunal shall dismiss the appeal where it finds that the appeal is unfounded. It
may also dismiss the appeal on an expedited basis where it is clear that the appeal is manifestly

unfounded.

3. If the Appeal Tribunal finds that the appeal is well founded, the decision of the Appeal
Tribunal shall modify or reverse the legal findings and conclusions in the provisional award in
whole or part. Its decision shall specify precisely how it has modified or reversed the relevant

findings and conclusions of the Tribunal.

EU/VN/IPA/en 97

4. Where the facts established by the Tribunal so permit, the Appeal Tribunal shall apply its own
legal findings and conclusions to such facts and render a final decision. If that is not possible, it

shall refer the matter back to the Tribunal.

5. Asa general rule, the appeal proceedings shall not exceed 180 days calculated from the date
on which a party to the dispute formally notifies its decision to appeal to the date on which the
Appeal Tribunal issues its decision. When the Appeal Tribunal considers that it cannot issue its
decision within 180 days, it shall inform the disputing parties in writing of the reasons for the delay
together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its decision. Unless exceptional

circumstances so require, the proceedings shall in no case exceed 270 days.

6. A disputing party lodging an appeal shall provide security, including the costs of appeal, as
well as a reasonable amount to be determined by the Appeal Tribunal in light of the circumstances

of the case.

7. Articles 3.37 (Third-Party Funding), 3.46 (Transparency of Proceedings), 3.47 (Interim
Decisions), 3.49 (Discontinuance), 3.51 (The Non-Disputing Party), Article 3.53 (Provisional
Award) and 3.56 (Indemnification or Other Compensation) apply in respect of the appeal

procedure, mutatis mutandis.

ARTICLE 3.55

Final Award

1. | A provisional award issued pursuant to this Section shall become final if neither disputing
party has appealed the provisional award pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 3.54 (Appeal

Procedure).

2. | When a provisional award has been appealed and the Appeal Tribunal has dismissed the
appeal pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 3.54 (Appeal Procedure), the provisional award shall
become final on the date of dismissal of the appeal by the Appeal Tribunal.

3. | When a provisional award has been appealed and the Appeal Tribunal has rendered a final
decision, the provisional award as modified or reversed by the Appeal Tribunal shall become final

on the date of the issuance of the final decision of the Appeal Tribunal.

4. | When a provisional award has been appealed and the Appeal Tribunal has modified or
reversed the legal findings and conclusions of the provisional award and referred the matter back to
the Tribunal, the Tribunal shall, after hearing the disputing parties if appropriate, revise its
provisional award to reflect the findings and conclusions of the Appeal Tribunal. The Tribunal shall
be bound by the findings made by the Appeal Tribunal. The Tribunal shall seek to issue its revised
award within 90 days of receiving the decision of the Appeal Tribunal. The revised provisional

award will become final 90 days after its issuance.

EU/VN/IPA/en 99

5. For the purposes of this Section, the term "final award" includes any final decision of the

Appeal Tribunal rendered pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 3.54 (Appeal Procedure).

ARTICLE 3.56

Indemnification or Other Compensation

The Tribunal shall not accept as a valid defence, counterclaim, set-off or similar claim the fact that

the investor has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation pursuant to an

insurance or a guarantee contract in respect of all or part of the compensation sought in a dispute

initiated pursuant to this Section.

ARTICLE 3.57

Enforcement of Final Awards

1. Final awards issued pursuant to this Section:

(a) shall be binding between the disputing parties and in respect of that particular case; and

(b) shall not be subject to appeal, review, set aside, annulment or any other remedy.

EU/VN/IPA/en 100

2. Each Party shall recognise a final award rendered pursuant to this Section as binding and
enforce the pecuniary obligation within its territory as if it were a final judgment of a court in that

Party.

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs | and 2, during the period referred to in paragraph 4, the
recognition and enforcement of a final award in respect of a dispute where Viet Nam is the
respondent shall be conducted pursuant to the New York Convention of 1958. During that time,
subparagraph 1(b) of this Article and subparagraph 3(b) of Article 3.36 (Consent) do not apply to

disputes where Viet Nam is the respondent.

4. In respect of a final award where Viet Nam is the respondent, subparagraph 1(b) and
paragraph 2 apply after a period of five years following the date of entry into force of this

Agreement, or a longer period determined by the Committee should the conditions warrant it.

5. The execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of

judgments or awards in force where such execution is sought.

6. For greater certainty, Article 4.14 (No Direct Effect) shall not prevent the recognition,

execution and enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to this Section.
7. For the purposes of Article 1 of the New York Convention of 1958, final awards issued

pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be arbitral awards and to relate to claims arising out of a

commercial relationship or transaction.

EU/VN/IPA/en 101

8. For greater certainty and subject to subparagraph 1(b), where a claim has been submitted to
dispute settlement pursuant to subparagraph 2(a) of Article 3.33 (Submission of a Claim), a final
award issued pursuant to this Section shall qualify as an award under Section 6 of Chapter IV of the

ICSID Convention.

ARTICLE 3.58

Role of the Parties to the Agreement

1. The Parties shall not give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of
a dispute submitted under this Section, unless the other Party has failed to abide by and comply

with the award rendered in such dispute. Diplomatic protection, for the purposes of this paragraph,
shall not include informal diplomatic exchanges for the sole purpose of facilitating a settlement of

the dispute.

2. Paragraph | shall not exclude the possibility of dispute settlement under

Section A (Resolution of Disputes between Parties) in respect of a measure of general application if
that measure is alleged to have breached the Agreement and in respect of which a dispute has been
initiated with regard to a specific investment pursuant to Article 3.33 (Submission of a Claim). This
is without prejudice to Article 3.51 (The Non-Disputing Party) or Article 5 of the UNCITRAL

Transparency Rules.

EU/VN/IPA/en 102

ARTICLE 3.59

Consolidation

1. Incase that two or more claims submitted under this Section have a question of law or fact in

(a) the names and addresses of the disputing parties to the claims sought to be consolidated;

(b) the scope of the consolidation sought; and

(c) the grounds for the request.

The respondent shall deliver the request to each claimant in a claim which the respondent seeks to

consolidate.

2.  If all disputing parties to the claims sought to be consolidated agree to the consolidation of the
claims, the disputing parties shall submit a joint request to the President of the Tribunal pursuant to
paragraph |. The President of the Tribunal shall, after receipt of such joint request, constitute a new
division of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 3.38 (Tribunal) (hereinafter referred to as the
"consolidating division") which shall have jurisdiction over all or part of the claims which are

subject to the joint consolidation request.

EU/VN/IPA/en 103

3. If the disputing parties referred to in paragraph 2 have not reached an agreement on
consolidation within 30 days of the receipt of the request for consolidation referred to in
paragraph | by the last claimant to receive it, the President of the Tribunal shall constitute a
consolidating division pursuant to Article 3.38 (Tribunal). The consolidating division shall assume
jurisdiction over all or part of the claims if, after considering the views of the disputing parties, it
decides that doing so would best serve the interest of a fair and efficient resolution of the claims,

including the interest of consistency of awards.

4. The consolidating division shall conduct its proceedings under the dispute settlement rules
chosen by agreement of the claimants from those referred to in paragraph 2 of

Article 3.33 (Submission of a Claim).

5. If the claimants have not agreed upon the dispute settlement rules within 30 days of the date
of receipt of the request for consolidation by the last claimant to receive it, the consolidating

division shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with the arbitration rules of UNCITRAL.

6. Divisions of the Tribunal constituted under Article 3.38 (Tribunal) shall cede jurisdiction in
relation to the claims, or parts thereof, over which the consolidating division has jurisdiction and the
proceedings of such divisions shall be stayed or adjourned, as appropriate. The award of the
consolidating division in relation to the parts of the claims over which it has assumed jurisdiction
shall be binding on the divisions which have jurisdiction over the remainder of the claims, as of the

date the award becomes final pursuant to Article 3.55 (Final Award).

EU/VN/IPA/en 104

7. A claimant may withdraw the claim or a part thereof subject to consolidation from dispute
settlement proceedings under this Article and such claim or part thereof may not be resubmitted

under Article 3.33 (Submission of a Claim).

8. At the request of the respondent, the consolidating division, on the same basis and with the
same effect as set out in paragraphs 3 and 6, may decide whether to assume jurisdiction over all or
part of a claim falling within the scope of paragraph | which is submitted after the initiation of
consolidation proceedings.

9. At the request of one of the claimants, the consolidating division may take appropriate
measures in order to preserve the confidentiality of protected information of that claimant vis-d-vis
other claimants. Such measures may include the submission of redacted versions of documents
containing protected information to the other claimants or arrangements to hold parts of the hearing
in private.
