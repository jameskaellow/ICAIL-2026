(b) operations to ensure the preservation of products in good
condition during transport and storage such as drying, freezing,
ventilation, chilling and like operations;

generally accepted accounting principles of the Party in which the
production is performed, or any other methods accepted by both Parties.

Each Party shall provide that an inventory management method selected
under paragraph 1 of this Article for particular fungible goods or
materials shall continue to be used for those fungible goods or materials

extended by up to one year if the competent authority of the
importing Party determine, in conformity with the procedures
specified in this Article, that the measure continues to be
necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury and to facilitate
adjustment and that there is evidence that the industry is
adjusting, provided that the total period of application of a
safeguard measure, including the period of initial application and
any extension thereof, shall not exceed three years; or

(c) beyond the expiration of the transition period.

No bilateral safeguard measure shall be applied to the import of an

I.

In critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which it
would be difficult to repair, a Party may apply a provisional safeguard
measure, which shall take the form of the measures set out in Article 7,2

there is clear evidence that imports of an originating good from the other

7-4

Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a
customs duty under this Agreement, and such increased imports have
caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry
of the importing Party.

determination, the Party shall publish a public notice setting forth how
interested parties, including importers and exporters, may obtain a non-
confidential copy of the application requesting a provisional safeguard
measure, and shall to the extent practicable, provide interested parties
adequate opportunity after the date it publishes the notice to submit
evidence and views regarding the application of a provisional safeguard
measure.

The applying Party shall notify the other Party prior to applying a
provisional safeguard measure and shall initiate consultations
immediately after the provisional safeguard measure is applied.

The duration of any provisional safeguard measure shall not exceed
200 days, during which period the Party applying that provisional
safeguard measure shall comply with the requirements of Article 7.4.

The Party shall promptly refund any tariff increases collected if the
investigation described in Article 7.4 (1) does not result in a finding that
the requirements of Article 7.2 are met.

A Party may not apply a provisional safeguard measure until at least 45
days after the date its competent authority initiates the investigation.

Article 7.7: Compensation



A Party proposing to apply or extend a bilateral safeguard measure shall,
in consultation with the other Party, provide to the other Party mutually
agreed, adequate means of trade compensation in the form of
concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent
to the value of the additional customs duties expected to result from the
measure. The Party applying a bilateral safeguard measure shall provide
the opportunity to consult within 30 days of the date on which the
bilateral safeguard measure was applied.

If the consultations referred to in paragraph 1 do not result in an
agreement on trade compensation within 30 days of the commencement
of such consultations, the other Party may suspend the application of
substantially equivalent concessions to the trade in goods of the Party
applying the bilateral safeguard measure.

A Party who intends to suspend the application of concessions shall
deliver a written notice to the other Party applying the bilateral safeguard
measure at least 30 days before it suspends the application of
concessions in accordance with paragraph 2,

The right to suspend the application of concessions in accordance with
paragraph 2 shall not be exercised for the first two years during which
the bilateral safeguard measure is in effect, provided that the bilateral
safeguard measure has been applied as a result of an absolute increase
in imports and that such a bilateral safeguard measure conforms to the
provisions of this Section.

The obligation to provide compensation under paragraph | and the right
to suspend the application of concessions in accordance with paragraph
2 shall cease on the termination of the bilateral safeguard measure.

Any compensation shall be based on the total period of application of

the bilateral safeguard measure including, if applicable, the period of
application of any provisional safeguard measure.

should also be recognised,

a means of discrimination between the other Party and non-Parties in the
application of its standards or criteria for the authorisation, licensing or
certification of service suppliers, or a disguised restriction on trade in
services.

their respective territories responsible for issuance and recognition of
