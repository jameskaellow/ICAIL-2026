certification of origin and has reason to believe that it contains or is based on incorrect information,

mutatis mutandis.

Article 7.4: International Standards, Guides and Recommendations

' Any reference made in this Chapter to standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures,
includes those related to metrology.

7-1

1. The Parties recognise the important role that international standards, guides and
recommendations can play in supporting greater regulatory alignment, good regulatory practice
and reducing unnecessary barriers to trade.

2. In this respect, and further to Articles 2.4 and 5.4 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, to
determine whether an international standard, guide or recommendation within the meaning of
Articles 2 and 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement exists, each Party shall apply the Decisions
and Recommendations adopted by the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade Since 1

January 1995 (G/TBT/1/Reyv.13), as may be revised, issued by the WTO Committee on Technical
Barriers to Trade.

Article 7.5: Cooperation and Trade Facilitation
1. The Parties shall seek to identify, develop and promote trade facilitation initiatives related to
standards, technical regulations, and conformity assessment procedures. Such initiatives may

include:

(a) enhancing knowledge and understanding of the Parties’ respective systems with the
aim of facilitating market access;

(b) promoting the compatibility or equivalence of technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures;

(c) promoting alignment or harmonisation with international standards; or
(d) recognising and accepting the results of conformity assessment procedures.

2. The Parties recognise the existence of a wide range of mechanisms to support greater
regulatory alignment and eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade in the region, including:

(a) encouraging regulatory dialogue and cooperation, through means such as:
(i) exchanging information on regulatory approaches and practices;
(ii) promoting the use of good regulatory practices to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of standards, technical regulations and conformity assessment

procedures;

(iii) providing technical advice, assistance and cooperation, on mutually agreed terms
and conditions, to:

(A) improve practices related to the development, implementation and review
of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures;

7-2

(B) improve competency and support the implementation of this Chapter; or

(b) encouraging greater use of international standards, guides and recommendations as a
basis for technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures.

3. With respect to paragraphs 1 and 2, the Parties recognise that the choice of the appropriate
initiatives or mechanisms in a given regulatory context depends on a variety of factors, such as the
product and sector involved, the volume and direction of trade, the relationship between the Parties’
respective regulators, the legitimate objectives pursued and the risks of non-fulfilment of those
objectives.

4. The Parties shall strengthen collaboration on mechanisms to facilitate the acceptance of the
results of the conformity assessment procedures, to support greater regulatory alignment and
eliminate unnecessary technical barriers to trade.

5. The Parties shall encourage cooperation between their respective organisations responsible
for technical regulation, standardisation, conformity assessment, accreditation and metrology,
whether they are governmental or non-governmental, with a view to addressing diverse issues
covered by this Chapter.

6. | When a Party detains at the point of entry a good originating in the territory of the other

applicable, its agent, as soon as possible the reasons for the detention.

7. Upon request, a Party shall provide, to the extent possible, information on the standards used
in a specific technical regulation.

8. Parties shall endeavour, to the extent possible, to cooperate in areas of mutual interest in
international standardisation forums. This cooperation may include the exchange of positions.

equivalent. The Party shall make the request in writing and set out detailed reasons why the
technical regulation should be considered equivalent, including reasons with respect to product
scope. If a Party does not agree that the technical regulation is equivalent it shall provide to the
other Party, upon request, the reasons for its decision.

Article 7.7: Conformity Assessment

7-3

1. Each Party recognises that there is a wide range of mechanisms to facilitate the acceptance
of the results of the conformity assessment procedures carried out in the territory of the other Party,
which may include:

(a) voluntary arrangements between the conformity assessment bodies in the territory of
the Parties;

(b) agreements on the mutual recognition of the results of conformity assessment
procedures performed by bodies located in its territory and the other Party’s territory
with respect to specific technical regulations;

(c) use of accreditation to qualify conformity assessment bodies, particularly international
systems of accreditation;

(d) recognition of regional and international mutual recognition arrangements between or
among accreditation bodies or conformity assessment bodies.

(e) government approval or designation of conformity assessment bodies;

(f) unilateral recognition of the results of conformity assessment bodies located in the
territory of the other Party; and

(g) acceptance by the importing Party of a supplier's declaration of conformity.

2. The Parties shall strengthen the exchange of information in relation to these and similar
mechanisms, in order to facilitate the acceptance of the results of the conformity assessment
procedures. Parties recognise that the choice of the appropriate mechanisms in a given regulatory
context depends on a variety of factors, such as the product and sector involved, the volume and
direction of trade, the relationship between the Parties’ respective regulators, the legitimate
objectives pursued and the risks of non-fulfilment of those objectives.

3. If a Party does not accept the results of the conformity assessment procedures carried out in
the other Party's territory, it shall, upon the other Party’s request, explain the reasons for its
decision.

4. _ Each Party shall accord to conformity assessment bodies located in the territory of the other
Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords to conformity assessment bodies located in
its own territory or in the territory of any other Party to the Pacific Alliance. In order to ensure that
it accords such treatment, each Party shall apply the same or equivalent procedures, criteria and
other conditions to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise conformity assessment bodies
located in the territory of the other Party that it may apply to conformity assessment bodies in its
own territory.

7-4

5. Paragraph 4 shall not preclude a Party from undertaking conformity assessment in relation
to a specific product solely within specified government bodies located in its own territory or in
the other Party’s territory, in a manner consistent with its obligations under the TBT Agreement.

6. If a Party refuses to accredit, approve, license or otherwise recognise a body located in the
territory of the other Party that assesses the conformity of a specific technical regulation, it shall,
upon request, explain the reasons for its refusal.

7. Further to Article 5.2.5 of the TBT Agreement, each Party shall limit any conformity
assessment fee imposed by the Party to the approximate cost of the services rendered to do the
assessment.

8. Each Party shall give positive consideration to negotiating mutual recognition agreements
for the results of its respective conformity assessment procedures carried out by bodies in the
territory of the other Party. If either of the Parties refuses to begin these negotiations it shall, upon
request, explain the reasons for its decision.

9. Further to Article 6.1 of the TBT Agreement, with the aim of building mutual confidence in
the results of the conformity assessment procedures, the Parties may request information on
conformity assessment bodies including aspects of technical competence, such as testing methods.

Article 7.8: Transparency

1. The Parties shall notify each other electronically, through the enquiry point established by
each Party in accordance with Article 10 of the TBT Agreement, of proposals for new technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and amendments to existing technical
regulations and conformity assessment procedures, as well as those adopted to address urgent
problems on the terms established by the TBT Agreement, at the same time that they send the
notification to the WTO Central Registry of Notifications. This notification shall include an
electronic link to the notified document, or a copy of that document.

2. Each Party shall notify even those proposals for new technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures and amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures that are in accordance with the technical content of relevant international
standards and that may have a significant effect on trade of the other Party.

3. Each Party shall respond in writing to the comments received from the other Party during the
consultation period stipulated in the notification, no later than the date of publication of the final
version of the technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure.

the consultation period stipulated in the notification.

5. Each Party shall publish preferably by electronic means, in a single official journal or website
all proposals for new technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and proposals
for amendments to existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, and all
new final technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures and final amendments to
existing technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures, of central government
bodies, that a Party is required to notify or publish under the TBT Agreement or this Chapter, and
that may have a significant effect on trade. ”

6. Each Party shall endeavour to notify final versions of technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures as an addendum to the original notification at the same time they are
adopted and made available to the public on a government website.

7. Each Party shall allow, in accordance with its own internal procedures, interested persons of
the other Party to participate in the development of its standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures, on terms no less favourable than those granted to its own
nationals.

8. Each Party shall recommend to non-governmental standardisation bodies recognised by that
Party in its territory that they observe paragraph 7 with respect to consultation processes for the
development of standards or voluntary conformity assessment procedures.

9. Each Party shall normally allow a period of at least 60 days, from the date it submits a
notification under this Article, in order to enable the other Party or interested person from the other
Party to make written comments on the proposed technical regulations and conformity assessment
procedures, except when urgent problems of safety, health, environmental protection or national
security arise or threaten to arise. Each Party shall positively consider reasonable requests of the
other Party to extend the comment period.

10. Subject to the conditions specified in Articles 2.12 and 5.9 of the TBT Agreement, regarding
the reasonable interval between the publication of the technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures and their entry into force, the Parties shall interpret the expression
“reasonable interval” as meaning, normally, a period of no less than six months, except when this
would be ineffective to fulfil the legitimate objectives pursued.

> For greater certainty, a Party may comply with this obligation by ensuring that the proposed and final measures in
this paragraph are published on, or otherwise accessible through, the WTO’s official website.

3 A Party satisfies this obligation by, for example, providing interested persons a reasonable opportunity to provide

comments on the measure it proposes to develop and taking those comments into account in the development of the
measure.

7-6

11. In the case of the existence of yearly or half-yearly work programmes related to technical
regulations, each Party shall, if it deems appropriate, endeavour to disclose to the public this
information through printed or electronic publications.

that it has the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an investment depends on such factors as the
nature and extent of the rights that the holder has under the Party’s law. Among such instruments that do not have the

Article 8.2: Scope
1. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:
(a) investors of the other Party;
(b) covered investments; and
(c) with respect to Article 8.9, all investments in the territory of that Party.
2. A Party’s obligations under this Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by:
(a) the central, regional or local governments or authorities of that Party; and
(b) any person, including a state enterprise or any other body, when it exercises any
governmental authority delegated to it by central, regional or local governments or

investors of the other Party, and investments of such investors, in financial institutions in the
Party’s territory.
4. For greater certainty, this Chapter shall not bind a Party in relation to an act or fact that took
place or a situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that
Party.
Article 8.3: Right to Regulate

1. The Parties reaffirm their right to regulate within their respective territories to achieve
legitimate policy objectives.

2. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or
enforcing any measure, otherwise consistent with this Chapter, that it considers appropriate to

ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental,
health or other regulatory objectives.

Article 8.4: Relation to other Chapters

7 For greater certainty, governmental authority is delegated under the Party’s law, including through a legislative grant
or a government order, directive or other action transferring or authorising the exercise of governmental authority.

8-4

1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter of this
Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

2. A requirement of a Party that a service supplier of the other Party post a bond or other form
of financial security as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service does not of itself make
this Chapter applicable to measures adopted or maintained by the Party relating to such cross-
border supply of the service. This Chapter shall apply to measures adopted or maintained by the
Party relating to the posted bond or financial security, to the extent that the bond or financial
security is a covered investment.

Article 8.5: National Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that
it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition,
expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its
territory.

2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it
accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to
the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other
disposition of investments.

3. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under paragraphs | and 2 means, with
respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable
treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, and to
investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.

4. For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in “like circumstances” under this Article
depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes
between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.

Article 8.6: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that
it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any non-Party, with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of
investments in its territory.

2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than it accords,
in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of investors of any non-Party, with respect to
the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other
disposition of investments.

8-5

3. For greater certainty, the treatment referred to in this Article does not encompass
international dispute resolution procedures or mechanisms such as those provided in Section B.
Substantive obligations in other international investment treaties and other trade agreements do not
in themselves constitute “treatment” and thus cannot give rise to a breach of this Article, absent
measures adopted by a Party.

4. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under this Article means, with respect
to a regional level of government other than at the federal level, treatment no less favourable than
the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government
to investors and to investments of such investors of any non-Party.

5. For greater certainty, whether treatment is accorded in “like circumstances” under this Article
depends on the totality of the circumstances, including whether the relevant treatment distinguishes
between investors or investments on the basis of legitimate public welfare objectives.

Article 8.7: Minimum Standard of Treatment®

1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with applicable
customary international law principles, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection
and security.

2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens as the standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments.
The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security” do not require
treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create
additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph | to provide:

(a) “fair and equitable treatment” includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal,
civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings, in accordance with the principle of

due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and

(b) “full protection and security” requires each Party to provide the level of police
protection required under customary international law.

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement or
another international agreement does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.

4. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a Party takes or fails to take an action that may be
inconsistent with an investor’s expectations does not constitute a breach of this Article, even if
there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.

8 Article 8.7 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 8-A.

8-6

5. For greater certainty, the mere fact that a subsidy or grant has not been issued, renewed or
maintained, or has been modified or reduced, by a Party, does not constitute a breach of this Article,
even if there is loss or damage to the covered investment as a result.

6. For greater certainty, the fact that a measure breaches domestic law does not, in and of itself,
establish a breach of this Article.

Article 8.8: Treatment in Case of Armed Conflict or Civil Strife

1. Notwithstanding Article 8.11.5(b), each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party and
to covered investments non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or
maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil

strife.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if an investor of a Party, in a situation referred to in paragraph
1, suffers a loss in the territory of the other Party resulting from:

(a) requisitioning of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or
authorities; or

(b) destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter’s forces or authorities,
which was not required by the necessity of the situation,

the latter Party shall provide the investor restitution, compensation or both, as appropriate, for that
loss.

3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to existing measures relating to subsidies or grants that would be
inconsistent with Article 8.5 but for Article 8.11.5(b).
Article 8.9: Performance Requirements
1. No Party shall, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management,
conduct, operation or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party or of a
non-Party in its territory, impose or enforce any requirement, or enforce any commitment or
undertaking’:

(a) to export a given level or percentage of goods or services;

(b) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;

° For greater certainty, a condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 3 does
not constitute a “requirement” or a “commitment or undertaking” for the purposes of paragraph 1.

8-7

c) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase
p p g p ry p
goods from persons in its territory;

(d) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports
or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with the investment;

(e) to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that the investment produces or
supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or
foreign exchange earnings;

(f) to transfer a particular technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge
to a person in its territory; or

(g) to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that the investment
produces or the services that it supplies to a specific regional market or to the world
market.

2. For greater certainty, a measure that requires an investment to use a technology to meet
health, safety or environmental requirements shall not be construed to be inconsistent with
paragraph 1. For greater certainty, Articles 8.5 and 8.6 apply to such a measure.

3. No Party shall condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with
the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation or sale or other
disposition of an investment, of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party in its territory, on
compliance with any requirement:

(a) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;

b) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase
p “cord a pr g p ry p
goods from persons in its territory;

(c) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports
or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with the investment; or

(d) to restrict sales of goods or services in its territory that the investment produces or
supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or
foreign exchange earnings.

4. Nothing in paragraph 3 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or
continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment of an investor of a Party or of
anon-Party in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service,

with any disputing party; and identify any person, government or other entity that has provided, or

proceedings, or unfairly prejudice any disputing party.

question, such as an objection that the dispute is not within the competence of the tribunal,
including an objection to the tribunal’s jurisdiction, a tribunal shall address and decide as a
preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is
not a claim for which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 8.32, or that
the claim is manifestly without legal merit:

(a) An objection under this paragraph shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible

after it has been constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the
respondent to submit its counter-memorial, or in the case of an amendment to the

8-21

Notice of Arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its
response to the amendment.

(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any
proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent
with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question,
and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.

(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph: that a claim submitted is not a claim for
which an award in favour of the claimant may be made under Article 8.32, the tribunal
shall assume to be true the claimant’s factual allegations in support of any claim in the
Notice of Arbitration, or any amendment thereof, and in disputes brought under the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in the relevant article
of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any other relevant
facts not in dispute.

(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence, including an objection
to jurisdiction, or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did
not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set
out in paragraph 5.

5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted,
the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 or any other objection
that the dispute is not within the tribunal’s competence, including an objection that the dispute 1s
not within the tribunal’s jurisdiction. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and
issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after
the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an
additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a
tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an
additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.

6. | When the tribunal decides a respondent’s objection under paragraphs 4 or 5, it may, if
warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney’s fees incurred in
submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the
tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant’s claim or the respondent’s objection was
frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.

7. For greater certainty, if an investor of a Party submits a claim under this Section, including a
claim alleging that a Party breached Article 8.7, the investor has the burden of proving all elements
of its claims, consistent with general principles of international law applicable to international
arbitration.

8. A respondent shall not assert as a defence, counterclaim, right of set-off, or for any other

reason, that the claimant has received or will receive indemnification or other compensation for all
or part of the alleged damages, pursuant to an insurance or guarantee contract.

8-22

9. A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing
party, or to ensure that the tribunal’s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to
preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal’s
jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to
constitute a breach referred to in Article 8.20. For the purposes of this paragraph, an order includes
a recommendation.

10. For greater certainty, upon request by the respondent, the tribunal may order the claimant to
provide security for all or part of the costs, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that there 1s
a risk the claimant may not be able to honour a potential costs award against it. In considering that
request, the tribunal may take into account evidence of third party funding. If the security for costs
is not posted in full within 30 days after the tribunal makes that order, or within any other time
period set by the tribunal, the tribunal shall so inform the disputing parties and may order the
suspension or termination of the proceedings.

11. In any arbitration conducted under this Section, at the request of any of the disputing parties,
a tribunal shall, before issuing a decision or award, transmit its proposed decision or award to the
disputing parties. Within 60 days after the tribunal transmits its proposed decision or award, the
disputing parties may submit written comments to the tribunal concerning any aspect of its
proposed decision or award. The tribunal shall consider any comments and issue its decision or
award no later than 45 days after the expiration of the 60 days comment period.

12. In the event that an appellate mechanism for reviewing awards rendered by investor-State

promptly transmit them to the non-disputing Party and make them available to the public:

(b) the Notice of Arbitration;

(c) pleadings, memorials and briefs submitted to the tribunal by a disputing party and any
written submission submitted pursuant to Article 8.25.2 and 8.25.3, and Article 8.31;

(d) minutes or transcripts of hearings of the tribunal, if available, and

8-23

(e) orders, awards and decisions of the tribunal.

2. The tribunal shall conduct hearings open to the public and shall determine, in consultation
with the disputing parties, the appropriate logistical arrangements. If a disputing party intends to
use information in a hearing that is designated as protected information or otherwise subject to
paragraph 3, it shall so advise the tribunal. The tribunal shall make appropriate arrangements to
protect such information from disclosure which may include closing the hearing for the duration
of the discussion of that information.

3. Nothing in this Section requires a respondent to make available to the public or otherwise
disclose during or after the arbitral proceedings, including the hearing, protected information, or to
furnish or allow access to information that it may withhold in accordance with Article 24.2
(Security Exceptions) or Article 24.4 (Disclosure of Information).”°

4. — Any protected information that is submitted to the tribunal shall be protected from disclosure
in accordance with the following procedures:

(a) subject to subparagraph (d), neither the disputing parties nor the tribunal shall disclose
to the non-disputing Party or to the public any protected information if the disputing
party that provided the information clearly designates it as such in accordance with
subparagraph (b);

(b) any disputing party claiming that certain information constitutes protected information
shall clearly designate the information according to any schedule set by the tribunal;

(c) a disputing party shall, according to any schedule set by the tribunal, submit a redacted
version of the document that does not contain the protected information. Only the
redacted version shall be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 1, and

(d) the tribunal, subject to paragraph 3, shall decide any objection regarding the
designation of information claimed to be protected information. If the tribunal
determines that the information was not properly designated, the disputing party that
submitted the information may:

(4) — withdraw all or part of its submission containing that information, or

(ii) agree to resubmit complete and redacted documents with corrected designations
in accordance with the tribunal’s determination and subparagraph (c).

In either case, the other disputing party shall, whenever necessary, resubmit complete
and redacted documents which either remove the information withdrawn under

0 For greater certainty, when a respondent chooses to disclose to the tribunal information that may be withheld in
accordance with Article 24.2 (Security Exceptions) or Article 24.4 (Disclosure of Information), the respondent may
still withhold that information from disclosure to the public.

subparagraph (d)(i) by the disputing party that first submitted the information or
redesignate the information consistent with the designation under subparagraph (d)(11)
of the disputing party that first submitted the information.

required to be disclosed by its law. The respondent should endeavour to apply those laws in a
manner sensitive to protecting from disclosure information that has been designated as protected
information.

note of the discontinuance in an order and issue an award on costs. After such an order has been
rendered the authority of the tribunal shall lapse. Unless the claimant’s failure to take steps in the
proceedings was despite its best endeavours to comply with the requirements under Section B, the
claimant may not subsequently submit a claim on the same matter.

3. Each Party shall ensure that its procuring entities comply with this Chapter in conducting
covered procurements.

treatment no less favourable than the treatment that the Party, including its procuring entities,
accords to:

(a) its domestic goods, services and suppliers; and

(b) goods, services and suppliers of any other Party to the Pacific Alliance.

2. With respect to any measure regarding covered procurement, no Party, including its
procuring entities, shall:

(a) treat a locally established supplier less favourably than another locally established

offered by that supplier for a particular procurement is a good or service of the other

Party.

and 2.

Measures Not Specific to Procurement
4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to:
(a) customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation,

the normal course of trade to that good.

Article 14.4: Offsets

With regard to covered procurement, a Party, including its procuring entities, shall not seek,
take account of, impose or enforce any offset, at any stage of a procurement.

Article 14.5: Valuation

1. In estimating the value of a procurement for the purposes of ascertaining whether it is a
covered procurement, a procuring entity shall:

(a) neither divide a procurement into separate procurements nor select or use a particular
valuation method for estimating the value of a procurement with the intention of
avoiding the obligations in this Chapter;

(b) include the maximum total value of the procurement over its entire duration, taking
into account all forms of remuneration, including any premium, fee, commission,
interest or other revenue stream that may be provided in the relevant procurement and,
where the procurement provides for the possibility of options, the total value of such
options; and

(c) where the procurement is to be conducted in multiple parts, with contracts to be
awarded at the same time or over a given period to one or more suppliers, base its
calculation of the total maximum value of the procurement over its entire duration.

2. If the total estimated maximum value of a procurement over its entire duration is not known,
the procurement shall be deemed as a covered procurement, unless otherwise excluded under this
Agreement.

Article 14.6: Technical Specifications

1. | A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe
any conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or effect of creating an unnecessary

obstacle to trade between the Parties.

2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the good or service being procured, a procuring
entity shall, if appropriate:

(a) set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional
requirements, rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and

14-6

(b) base the technical specifications on international standards, if these exist; otherwise,
on national technical regulations, recognised national standards or building codes.

3. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a
particular trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or
supplier, unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the
procurement requirements and provided that, in these cases, the procuring entity includes words
such as “or equivalent” in the tender documentation.

4. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of
precluding competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adoption of any technical
specification for a specific procurement from a person that may have a commercial interest in the
procurement.

5. For greater certainty, this Article is not intended to preclude a procuring entity from
preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications to promote the conservation of natural
resources or the protection of the environment.

6. For greater certainty, a procuring entity may conduct market research in developing
specifications for a particular procurement.

7. For greater certainty, this Chapter is not intended to preclude a Party, or its procuring entities,
from preparing, adopting or applying technical specifications required to protect sensitive
government information, including specifications that may affect or limit the storage, hosting or
processing of such information outside the territory of the Party.

Article 14.7: Publication of Procurement Information

14-7

electronic means listed in Section I of its Schedule to Annex 14-A. The notices shall remain readily
accessible to the public until at least the expiration of the time period for responding to the notice
or the deadline for submission of the tender.

2. The notices shall, if accessible by electronic means, be provided free of charge:

(a) for central government entities that are covered under Annex 14-A, through a single
point of access; and
(b) for sub-central government entities and other entities covered under Annex 14-A,
through links in a single electronic portal.
3. Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, each notice of intended procurement shall include

at least the following information, unless that information is provided in the tender documentation
that is made available free of charge to all interested suppliers at the same time as the notice of
intended procurement:

(a)

(b)
(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

and, if applicable, any limitation on the number of suppliers that will be permitted to
tender; and

14-8

(j) an indication that the procurement is covered by this Chapter unless that indication is
publicly available through information published pursuant to Article 14.7.

documentation if the notice of intended procurement includes all of the information set out in
paragraph 3.

Notice of Planned Procurement
5. Each Party shall encourage their procuring entities to publish in an electronic means listed in
Section I of its Schedule to Annex 14-A, as early as possible in each fiscal year, a notice regarding
their future procurement plans. Such notices shall include the subject matter of the procurement
and the planned date of publication of the notice of intended procurement.
Article 14.9: Limited Tendering
1. Provided that it does not use this provision for purposes of avoiding competition among
suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic
suppliers, a procuring entity may use limited tendering.
2. If a procuring entity uses limited tendering, it may choose, according to the nature of the
procurement, not to apply Article 14.6, Article 14.8, Article 14.10, Article 14.11, Article 14.12,
Article 14.13 or Article 14.14. A procuring entity may use limited tendering, only under the
following circumstances:

(a) if, in response to a prior notice, invitation to participate or invitation to tender:

(i) no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;

(ii) no tenders were submitted that conform to the essential requirements in the tender
documentation;

(i411) no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or
(iv) the tenders submitted were collusive. For greater certainty, a Party may provide
under its laws and regulations that a declaration that tenders are collusive must

be made by a competent authority;

provided that the procuring entity does not substantially modify the requirements set out in
the notices or the tender documentation;

(b) if the goods or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no reasonable
alternative or substitute good or service exists for any of the following reasons:

14-9

(c)

(d)
(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

(i) the requirement is for a work of art;
(ii) the protection of patents, copyrights or other exclusive rights; or
(ii1) due to an absence of competition for technical reasons;

for additional deliveries by the original supplier or its authorised agents of goods or
services that were not included in the initial procurement where a change of supplier
for such additional goods or services:

(i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of
interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services
or installations procured under the initial procurement or due to conditions under
original supplier warranties; and

(ii) would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the
procuring entity;

for goods purchased on a commodity market;

if a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is intended for
limited trial or that is developed at its request in the course of, and for, a particular
contract for research, experiment, study or original development. Original development
of a prototype or a first good or service may include limited production or supply in
order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate that the prototype or
the first good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable
quality standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish
commercial viability or to recover research and development costs. Subsequent
procurements of these newly developed goods or services, however, shall be subject to
this Chapter;

if additional construction services that were not included in the initial contract but that
were within the objectives of the original tender documentation have, due to
unforeseeable circumstances, become necessary to complete the construction services
described therein. However, the total value of contracts awarded for additional
construction services may not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the initial contract;

insofar as is strictly necessary, if, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by
events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be
obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering;

if a contract is awarded to the winner of a design contest, provided that:

(i) | the contest has been organised in a manner that is consistent with this Chapter;

14-10

and

(11) the participants are judged by an independent jury with a view to award a design
contract to the winner; or

(i) | for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise
in the very short term, such as from unusual disposals, liquidation, bankruptcy or
receivership, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers.

3. A procuring entity shall prepare a report in writing or maintain a record for each contract
awarded in accordance with paragraph 2. Such report or record shall include the name of the
procuring entity, the value and kind of goods or services procured, and a statement that indicates
the circumstances and conditions described in paragraph 2 that justified the use of limited
tendering.

Article 14.10: Time Periods for the Submission of Tenders

General

1. A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for
a supplier to obtain the tender documentation and to prepare and submit a request for participation
and a responsive tender, taking into account factors such as:

(a) the nature and complexity of the procurement; and

(b) the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as
well as domestic points if electronic means are not used.

Deadlines

2. A procuring entity that uses selective tendering shall establish that the final date for the
submission of a request for participation shall not, in principle, be less than 25 days from the date
of publication of the notice of intended procurement. If a state of urgency duly substantiated by the
procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to no less
than 10 days.

3. Except as provided in paragraphs 4 and 5, a procuring entity shall establish that the final date
for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:

(b) in the case of selective tendering, the procuring entity notifies the suppliers that they
will be invited to submit tenders, whether or not it uses a multi-use list.

14-11

4. A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 by five
days for each one of the following circumstances:

(a) the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;

(b) the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the
publication of the notice of intended procurement; and

(c) the procuring entity accepts tenders by electronic means.

5. A procuring entity may reduce the time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to no less
than 10 days if:

(a) the procuring entity has published a notice of planned procurement under Article 14.8
at least 40 days and no more than 12 months in advance of the publication of the notice
of intended procurement, and the notice of planned procurement contains:

(i) a description of the procurement;

(ii) the approximate final dates for the submission of tenders or requests for
participation;

(111) the address from which documents relating to the procurement may be obtained;
and

(iv) as much of the information that is required for the notice of intended procurement
as is available;

(b) a state of urgency duly substantiated by the procuring entity renders impracticable the
time period for tendering set out in paragraph 3; or

(c) the procuring entity procures commercial goods or services.

6. The use of paragraph 4, in conjunction with paragraph 5, shall in no case result in the
reduction of the time periods for tendering set out in paragraph 3 to less than 10 days.

7. A procuring entity shall require all interested or participating suppliers to submit requests for
participation or tenders in accordance with a common deadline. These time periods, and any
extension of these time periods, shall be the same for all interested or participating suppliers.

8. | When a procuring entity covered under Section B and C of a Party’s Schedule to Annex 14-
A has selected all or a limited number of qualified suppliers, the time period for tendering may be
fixed by mutual agreement between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence
of agreement, the period shall not be less than 10 days.

14-12

Article 14.11: Tender Documentation

1. A procuring entity shall make available to suppliers tender documentation that includes all
information necessary to allow suppliers to prepare and submit responsive tenders.

2. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, that tender documentation
shall include at least a complete description of:

(a) the procurement, including the nature and the quantity of the goods or services to be
procured or, if the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements
to be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity certification, plans,
drawings or instructional materials;

(b) any conditions for participation for suppliers, including any financial guarantees,
information and tender documents that suppliers are required to submit in relation to
those conditions;

(c) all criteria to be considered in the awarding of the contract and, except where price is
the sole criterion, the relative importance of such criteria;

(d) where the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules, including
identification of the elements of the tender related to the evaluation criteria, upon which
the auction will be conducted;

(e) if there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time and place for the opening of
tenders;

(f) any date or time frame for delivery of goods or supply of services, or the duration of
the contract; and

(g) any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and the means by which
tenders may be submitted.

3. In establishing any date for the delivery of a good or the supply of a service being procured,
a procuring entity shall take into account factors such as the complexity of the procurement.

4. When a procuring entity does not publish all tender documents by electronic means, a
procuring entity shall make promptly available the tender documentation at the request of any
interested supplier.

5. | A procuring entity shall promptly reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by

an interested or participating supplier, provided that the information does not give that supplier an
advantage over other suppliers.

14-13

Modifications

6. — If, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the evaluation criteria or
requirements set out in a notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to a
participating supplier or amends or re-issues the notice or tender documentation referred to in
paragraph 2, it shall publish or provide those modifications or the amended or re-issued notice or
tender documentation in writing:

(a) to all suppliers that are participating in the procurement at the time of the modification,
amendment or re-issuance, if those suppliers are known to the procuring entity, and in
all other cases, in the same manner as the original information was made available; and

(b) in adequate time to allow those suppliers to modify and re-submit their initial tender,
if appropriate.

Article 14.12: Conditions for Participation

1. A procuring entity shall limit any conditions for participation in a covered procurement to
those conditions that ensure that a supplier has the legal and financial capacities and the commercial
and technical abilities to fulfil the requirements of that procurement.

2. In establishing the conditions for participation, a procuring entity:

(a) shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a
procurement, the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a
procuring entity of a given Party or that the supplier has prior work experience in the
territory of that Party; and

(b) may require relevant prior experience if essential to meet the requirements of the
procurement.

3. In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity
shall:

(a) evaluate the financial capacity and the commercial and technical abilities of a supplier
on the basis of that supplier’s business activities both inside and outside the territory of

the Party of the procuring entity; and

(b) base its evaluation solely on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in
advance in notices or tender documentation.

4. If authorised by a Party’s measures and there is supporting material, a Party, including its
procuring entities, may exclude a supplier on grounds such as:

14-14

(b)

adopt or apply any registration system or qualification procedure with the purpose or
the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the participation of suppliers of the other
Party in its procurement; or

use such registration system or qualification procedure to prevent or delay the inclusion
of suppliers of the other Party on a list of suppliers or prevent those suppliers from
being considered for a particular procurement.

Selective Tendering

3. If a Party’s measures authorise the use of selective tendering, and if a procuring entity intends
to use selective tendering, the procuring entity shall:

(a)

(b)

participation in a covered procurement; and

include in the notice of intended procurement the information specified in Article

shall not exclude the supplier from consideration in respect of the procurement unless the procuring
entity is not able to complete the examination of the request within the time period allowed for the
submission of tenders.

procuring entity shall not penalise that supplier if the delay is due solely to the mishandling on the
part of the procuring entity.

of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall
provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers.

through good regulatory practices, facilitating increased trade in goods and services, as
well as investment between the Parties;

existence of mechanisms or processes that facilitate the effective interagency coordination and
review of proposed covered regulatory measures. For this purpose, each Party should consider
establishing and maintaining a national or central coordinating body or mechanism.

objective pursued by that Party. Regulatory impact assessments may encompass a range of
procedures to determine possible impacts.

2. Recognising that differences in the Parties’ institutional, social, cultural, legal and
developmental circumstances may result in specific regulatory approaches, the regulatory impact
assessment procedure should, among other things:

(a) assess the need for a proposed regulatory measure, including a description of the nature
and significance of the problem;

(b) examine feasible alternatives, including, to the extent possible and consistent with their
laws and regulations, the corresponding costs and benefits, recognising that some costs
and benefits are difficult to quantify and monetise;

(c) explain the reasons for concluding that the selected alternative achieves the policy
objectives in an efficient manner, including, if appropriate, reference to the costs and
benefits and the potential for managing risks; and

(d) rely on the best reasonably obtainable existing information, including relevant
scientific, technical, economic or other information, within the boundaries of the
authorities, mandates, capacities and resources of the particular regulatory authority.

3. | When conducting regulatory impact assessments, the regulatory authorities may take into
consideration the potential impact of the proposed regulation on SMEs.

4. To the extent appropriate and consistent with its laws and regulations, each Party should
encourage its relevant regulatory authorities to consider regulatory measures of the other Party, as
well as relevant developments in international, regional and other fora when developing covered
regulatory measures.

5. Each Party should ensure, that new covered regulatory measures are plainly written, concise,

organised and easy to understand, recognising that some measures involve technical issues, for
which specialised knowledge might be required to understand and apply them.

20-3

6. Subject to its laws and regulations, each Party should ensure that relevant regulatory
authorities provide public access to information on new covered regulatory measures and, if
possible, make this information available online.

to determine whether they should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed so as to make
the regulatory regime of the Party more effective in achieving its policy objectives.

regulations, provide public notice, on an annual basis, of any covered regulatory measure that it
reasonably expects its regulatory authorities to issue within the following twelve-month period.

Article 23.21: Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits

1. | The responding Party shall, if requested by the complaining Party or Parties, enter into
negotiations with the complaining Party or Parties no later than 15 days after receipt of that request,

with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation, if:

(a) the responding Party has notified the complaining Party or Parties that it does not intend
to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or

(b) following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with
Article 23.20, there is disagreement between the disputing Parties as to whether the

responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

2. A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 3 if that
complaining Party and the responding Party have:

23-12

(a) been unable to agree on compensation within a period of 30 days after the period for
developing compensation has begun; or

(b) agreed on compensation but the relevant complaining Party considers that the
responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement.

3. A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met in
relation to that complaining Party, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to
suspend benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party
proposes to suspend.* The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later
of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the date that the Panel issues its
determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be.

4. In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 3, the complaining Party shall apply
the following principles and procedures:

(a) it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the
Panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist;

(b) if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same
subject matter, and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits
in a different subject matter. In the written notice referred to in paragraph 3, the
complaining Party shall indicate the reasons on which its decision to suspend benefits
in a different subject matter is based; and

(c) in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), it shall take into account:

(i) _ the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which
the Panel has found the non-conformity or nullification or impairment, and the
importance of that trade to the complaining Party;

(ii) that goods and services, other than financial services*, are each distinct subject
matters; and

(ii1) the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the
broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits.

5. if the responding Party considers that:

4 For greater certainty, the phrase “the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend” refers to the level of
concessions under this Agreement, the suspension of which a complaining Party considers will have an effect
equivalent to that of the non-conformity, or nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 23.3(c), determined to
exist by the Panel in its final report issued under Article 23.18.1.

> For greater certainty, “services” does not include financial services as defined in paragraph 5(a) of the Annex of
Financial Services of GATS.

23-13

(a) the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the
complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in
paragraph 4; or

(b) it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the Panel
has determined to exist,

it may, within 30 days of the date of delivery of the written notice provided by the complaining
Party under paragraph 3, request that the Panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The
responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The Panel shall
reconvene as soon as possible after the date of delivery of the request and shall present its
determination to the disputing Parties no later than 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request
under subparagraph (a) or (b), or 120 days after it reconvenes for a request under both
subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the Panel determines that the level of benefits the complaining Party
proposes to suspend is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to
be of equivalent effect.

6. Unless the Panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity
or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the
Panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the Panel has not determined the level, the level the
complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 3. If the Panel determines that the
complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the Panel
shall set out in its determination the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits
in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set
out in paragraph 4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with
the Panel’s determination.

Article 23.22: Compliance Review

1. | Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 23.21, if a responding Party considers that it
has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the Panel, it may
refer the matter to the Panel by providing a written notice to the complaining Party or Parties. The
Panel shall issue its report on the matter no later than 90 days after the responding Party provides
written notice.

2. If the Panel determines that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the
nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits
suspended under Article 23.21.

Article 23.23: Administration of Dispute Settlement Proceedings

other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes

between private parties in the free trade area.

agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in those disputes.
