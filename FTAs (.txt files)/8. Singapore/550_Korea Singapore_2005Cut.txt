ARTICLE 4.9 : ACCUMULATION
Originating materials from the territory of a Party incorporated in the production of
a good in the territory of the other Party, shall be considered to originate in the territory of the other Party.
For the purpose of establishing that a good is originating, the producer of a good may accumulate one's production with the production, in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers, of materials incorporated in the production of the good, so that the production of those materials is considered as done by that producer, provided that the good complies with the criteria set out in Article 4.2.

ARTICLE 4.10 : DE MINIMIS
A good that does not undergo a change in tariff classification pursuant to Annex 4A shall be considered as originating if:

Paragraph 1 shall not apply to:
a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapters 1 through 14 of the Harmonised System; and
a non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapters 15 through 24 of the Harmonised System unless the non-originating material is provided for in a different subheading from that of the good for which the origin is being determined under this Article.
A good provided for in Chapters 50 through 63 of the Harmonised System that is not an originating good, because certain fibres or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, shall
nonetheless be considered as originating if the total weight of all such fibres or yarns in that component is not more than eight (8) per cent of the total weight of that component. ARTICLE 4.11 : FUNGIBLE GOODS AND MATERIALS
The determination of whether fungible goods or materials are originating goods
shall be made either by physical segregation of each good or material or through the use of any of the inventory management method, such as averaging, last-in, first-out, or first

in, first-out, recognised in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a Party in which the production is performed or otherwise accepted by the Party in which the production is performed.
Once a particular inventory management method is selected under paragraph 1, that method shall continue to be used for those fungible goods or materials throughout the fiscal year of the person that selected the inventory management method. ARTICLE 4.12 : ACCESSORIES, SPARE PARTS AND TOOLS
Accessories, spare parts, or tools, delivered with a good that form part of standard accessories, spare parts or tools of the good, shall be considered as originating if the good is an originating good, and shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, provided that:
the accessories, spare parts or tools are not invoiced separately from the good; and
the quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts or tools are customary for the good.
If the good is subject to a regional value-content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts or tools shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the
good.
ARTICLE 4.13 : PACKAGING MATERIALS AND CONTAINERS FOR RETAIL SALE
Packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale
shall, if classified with the good, be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo the applicable change
in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A, and, if the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of such packaging materials and containers shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in  calculating the regional value content of the good.

ARTICLE 4.14 : PACKING MATERIALS AND CONTAINERS FOR SHIPMENT
Packing materials and containers in which a good is packed for shipment shall be disregarded in determining whether:
the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex 4A; and
the good satisfies a regional value content requirement. ARTICLE 4.15 : DIRECT CONSIGNMENT
A good shall not be considered to be an originating good of a Party by reason of having undergone production that satisfies the requirements of Article 4.2, if, subsequent to that production:
the good is not transported directly to the territory of the other Party; or
where the good is shipped through or transshipped in the territory of a country that is not a Party under this Agreement, the importer has failed to meet the requirements stipulated in paragraph (c) of Article 5.9.
ARTICLE 4.16 : NON-QUALIFYING OPERATIONS
Notwithstanding any provision in this Chapter, a good shall not be considered to
have satisfied the requirements for an originating good in Article 4.2 merely by reason of going through certain operations or processes including, inter alia, the following :

The importing Party may request the importer in paragraph 1 to provide relevant documents to certify that the good qualifies as an originating good.
ARTICLE 5.7 : VERIFICATIONS FOR PREFERENTIAL TARIFF TREATMENT
For the purposes of determining whether a good imported into its territory from the territory of the other Party is eligible for preferential tariff treatment, the importing
Party may, through its customs administration, conduct a verification, which may be in sequence, by means of:
request for a certificate of origin from the importer;
request for Cost and Production Statement and information from the importer for cases where the importer is able to prepare it on the basis of the importer's own documentary evidence or information;
request for Cost and Production Statement and information from an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party through the other Party's  customs administration;
visit to the premises of an exporter or a producer in the territory of the other Party to review the records referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 5.5 and observe the facilities used in the production of the good, or to that effect any facilities used in the production of the materials; or
such other procedure as the Parties may agree to.
The importer, exporter or producer that receives a written request pursuant to subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) of paragraph 1 shall answer and return it within a period of thirty (30) days from the date on which it was received. During this period, the
importer, exporter or producer may have one opportunity to make a written request to the Party conducting the verification for an extension of the answering period, for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days.

In the case where the importer, exporter, or producer does not return the written request for information made by the importing Party within the given period or its extension, or that the information provided is false or incomplete, the Party may deny preferential tariff treatment.

deliver a written notification of its intention to conduct the visit to:
the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited; and

Each Party shall provide that, upon receipt of notification pursuant to paragraph 4, such an exporter or producer may, within fifteen (15) days of receiving the notification, have one opportunity to request to the Party conducting the verification for a postponement of the proposed verification visit, for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days. This extension shall be notified to the customs administration of the importing and exporting Parties.
A Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a good solely because a verification visit was postponed pursuant to paragraph 6.
After the conclusion of a verification visit, the Party conducting the verification, shall provide the exporter or producer whose good was verified, with a written determination of whether the good is eligible for preferential tariff treatment, based on the relevant law and findings of fact.
Where verifications by a Party show that an exporter or producer repeatedly makes false or unsupported representations that a good imported into the Party's

territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may suspend the preferential tariff treatment to be accorded to subsequent shipment of identical good exported or produced by such a person until that person establishes that the shipment complies with Chapter 4 (Rules of Origin), in accordance with its domestic laws, regulations or practices. The importing Party shall inform the customs administration of the exporting Party on the evidence and details of the suspension made.
ARTICLE 5.8 : ADVANCE RULINGS

if the ruling was based on an error of fact;
if there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling was based;
to conform with an amendment to this Agreement; or
to conform with a judicial or administration decision or a change in its domestic laws and regulations.
Each Party shall provide that any modification or revocation of an advance ruling
is effective on the date on which the modification or revocation is issued, or on such a later date as may be specified therein, and shall not be applied to importations of a good that have occurred prior to that date, unless the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.
Notwithstanding paragraph 5, the issuing Party shall postpone the effective date of such modification or revocation for a period not exceeding sixty (60) days where the person to whom the advance ruling was issued demonstrates that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on that ruling.
Each Party shall provide that where it issues an advance ruling to a person that has misrepresented or omitted material facts or circumstances or failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ruling, the Party may impose penalties or deny the preferential tariff treatment as the circumstances may warrant.
A good that is subject to an origin verification process or any instance of review or appeal in the territory of one of the Parties may not be the subject of an advance ruling.
Subject to paragraph 10, each Party shall apply an advance ruling to importations into its territory of the relevant good from the date of its issuance or from such later date     as may be specified in the ruling.
The importing Party shall apply the advance ruling for three (3) years from the date of issuance of the ruling.

Upon the termination of the measure, the rate of customs duty shall be the rate which would have been in effect but for the measure.

In critical circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be
difficult to repair, a Party may take a measure described in paragraph 1 on a provisional basis pursuant to a preliminary determination that there is clear evidence that imports from the other Party have increased as the result of the reduction or elimination of a customs duty under this Agreement, and such imports constitute a substantial cause of serious injury, or threat thereof, to the domestic industry. The duration of such provisional measure shall not exceed 200 days, during which time the requirements of paragraph 2 shall be met.

and which is subject to that Party's obligations under Articles 9.3 and 9.5, the Party shall 9-5 The term "relevant international organisations" refers to international bodies whose membership is
open to relevant bodies of both Parties.

ensure that such a supplier does not abuse its monopoly position to act in its territory in a manner inconsistent with such commitments.

At the request of the other Party, it shall hold consultations with a view to reaching agreement on any necessary adjustment required to maintain the overall balance of commitments
undertaken by each Party under this Agreement. If agreement is not reached between the Parties on any necessary adjustment, the matter may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Chapter 20 (Dispute Settlement).
Paragraph 1 shall not be construed to prejudice the right of both Parties to maintain any existing measure or adopt new measures consistent with the reservations set out in Annexes 9A and 9B.

may modify or add to its reservations as set out in Annex 9A in respect of any measure inconsistent with Article 9.5 so long as such a measure has been maintained by that Party before the date of the signature of this Agreement.

Nothing in this Chapter shall affect the rights and obligations of the Parties as members of the International Monetary Fund under the Articles of Agreement of the Fund, including the use of exchange actions which are in conformity with the Articles of Agreement, provided that a Party shall not impose restrictions on any capital transactions inconsistently with its obligations under this Chapter regarding such transactions, except under Article 9.16, or at request of the Fund.
ARTICLE 9.16 : BALANCE- OF- PAYMENTS EXCEPTION

This Chapter does not apply to services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority (such as law enforcement, correctional services, income security or insurance, social security10-4 or insurance, social welfare, public education, public training, health, and child care), provided that such services are supplied neither on a commercial basis, nor in competition with one or more service suppliers.
ARTICLE 10.3: RELATION TO OTHER CHAPTERS
This provision will be applied only when the investment of the investor of the Party suffers loss
through the imposition of performance requirements to an investment of investor of a non-Party . 10-4 For the purpose of Article 10.11, both Parties agree that social security, public retirement or compulsory savings schemes run by the government, such as the Central Provident Fund of Singapore, fall within the scope of "services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority".

In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter in this Agreement, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.
The requirement by a Party that a service provider of the other Party post a bond or other form of financial security as a condition of providing a service into its territory does not of itself make this Chapter applicable to the provision of that cross-border service. This Chapter applies to that Party's treatment of the posted bond or financial security.
This Chapter does not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter 12 (Financial Services) unless specified otherwise therein.
ARTICLE 10.4: NATIONAL TREATMENT
Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.
Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.
The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a local government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that local government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part, including itself.
ARTICLE 10.5: MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT
Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Party treatment in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

The concepts of "fair and equitable treatment" and "full protection and security"
in paragraph 1 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens and do not create additional substantive rights.
The obligation to provide "fair and equitable treatment" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.
The obligation to provide "full protection and security" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.
The "customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens" refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.
A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.
ARTICLE 10.6: ACCESS TO THE JUDICIAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES
Each Party shall within its territory accord to investors of the other Party treatment
no less favourable than the treatment which it accords in like circumstances to its own investors, with respect to access to its courts of justice and administrative tribunals and agencies in all degrees of jurisdiction both in pursuit and in defence of such investors' rights.
ARTICLE 10.7: PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

to act in a manner not inconsistent with other provisions of this Agreement; or
to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that it produces or the services that it supplies to a specific regional market or to the world market.
The provisions of paragraph 1 do not preclude either Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with investment and business activities in its territory of an investor of the other Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs 1 (d), (g) and (h).
Nothing in paragraph 1 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party or of a non-Party, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, provide a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.
Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade or investment, nothing in paragraphs 1(b), (c) or (d) shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including environmental measures:

necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

necessary for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.

Neither Party may require that an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of
an investor of the other Party appoint to senior management positions individuals of any particular nationality.
A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is an investment of an investor of the other Party, be of a particular nationality, or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.
ARTICLE 10.9: NON-CONFORMING MEASURES

any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by a Party as set out in its Schedule to Annex 9A;

Articles 10.4 and 10.8 shall not apply to:
government procurement by a Party; or
subsidies or grants provided by a Party, or to any conditions attached to the receipt or continued receipt of such subsidies or grants, whether or not such subsidies or grants are offered exclusively to investors of the Party or investments of investors of the Party, including government-supported loans, guarantees and insurance.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed so as to derogate from rights and obligations under international agreements in respect of protection of intellectual property rights to which both Parties are party, including the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and other treaties concluded under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation.
ARTICLE 10.10: FUTURE LIBERALISATION
If a Party makes any further liberalisation of the remaining restrictions scheduled  in conformity with Article 10.9 by an agreement with a non-Party, it shall afford adequate opportunity to the other Party to negotiate treatment granted therein on a mutually advantageous basis and with a view to securing an overall balance of rights and obligations.

Through the review mechanism pursuant to Article 22.1, the Parties will engage in further liberalisation with a view to reaching the reduction or elimination of the remaining restrictions scheduled in conformity with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10.9 on a mutually advantageous basis and securing an overall balance of rights and obligations.

prior to the institution of proceedings before any of the dispute settlement fora referred to in paragraph 3, for the preservation of its rights and interests.

act, a successor shall be appointed in the same manner as prescribed for the appointment of the original member and the successor shall have all the powers and duties of the original member. In such a case, any time period applicable to the arbitral panel proceedings shall be suspended for a period beginning on the date when the original member becomes unable to act and ending on the date when the new member is appointed.
Any person appointed as a member of the arbitral panel shall have expertise or experience in law, international trade, other matters covered by this Agreement or the resolution of disputes arising under international trade agreements. A member shall be chosen strictly on the bases of objectivity, reliability, sound judgment and independence and shall conduct himself or herself on the same bases throughout the course of the arbitration proceedings.

Additionally, the chair shall not have his or her usual place of residence in the territory of, nor be employed by, either Party.

ARTICLE 20.8 : TERMINATION OF PROCEEDINGS
The Parties may agree to terminate the proceedings before an arbitral panel at any time by jointly notifying the chair to this effect.
ARTICLE 20.9 : PROCEEDINGS OF ARBITRAL PANELS
Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the arbitral panel shall follow the model rules of procedure in the Annex 20A, which shall ensure:
that an arbitral panel shall meet in closed session;
a right to at least one hearing before the arbitral panel;
an opportunity for each Party to provide initial and rebuttal submissions;
that each Party's written submissions, written versions of its oral statement, and written response to a request or question from the arbitral panel may be made public after they are submitted, subject to clause (g);
that the arbitral panel may consider requests from non-governmental entities in the Parties' territories to provide written views regarding the dispute that
may assist the arbitral panel in evaluating the submissions and arguments of the Parties;
a reasonable opportunity for each Party to submit comments on the initial report presented pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article 20.11; and
the protection of confidential information.
The arbitral panel may, after consulting the Parties, adopt additional rules of procedure not inconsistent with the model rules.
ARTICLE 20.10 : INFORMATION AND TECHNICAL ADVICE
Upon request of a Party, or on its own initiative, the arbitral panel may seek information and technical advice from any person or body that it deems appropriate.  Any information and technical advice so obtained shall be made available to the Parties.
With respect to factual issues concerning a scientific or other technical matter raised by a Party, the arbitral panel may request advisory reports in writing from an

expert or experts. The arbitral panel may, at the request of a Party or on its own initiative, select, in consultation with the Parties, scientific or technical experts who
shall assist the arbitral panel throughout its proceedings, but who shall not have the right to vote in respect of any decision to be made by the arbitral panel.
ARTICLE 20.11 : INITIAL REPORT
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitral panel shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement, on the submissions and arguments of the Parties, and on any information before it, pursuant to Article 20.10.
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the arbitral panel shall, within ninety (90) days after the last member is selected, present to the Parties an initial report containing:
findings of law and/or fact together with reasons;
its determination as to the implementation, interpretation or application of this Agreement or whether the measure at issue is inconsistent with the obligations of this Agreement or causes nullification or impairment of any benefit accruing to a Party under this Agreement, or any other determination requested in the terms of reference; and
its recommendations, if any, on the means to resolve the dispute.
The Parties may submit written comments on the initial report within fourteen (14) days of its presentation.
In case that such written comments by the Parties are received as provided for in paragraph 3, the arbitral panel, on its own initiative or at the request of a Party, may reconsider its report and make any further examination that it considers appropriate after considering such written comments.
ARTICLE 20.12 : FINAL REPORT
The arbitral panel shall present a final report to the Parties, within thirty (30) days of presentation of the initial report, unless the Parties otherwise agree.

The final report of the arbitral panel shall be made publicly available within fifteen
(15) days of its delivery to the Parties.
ARTICLE 20.13 : IMPLEMENTATION OF FINAL REPORT
The final report of an arbitral panel shall be binding on the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal.
On receipt of the final report of an arbitral panel, the Parties shall agree on:
the means to resolve the dispute, which normally shall conform with the determinations or recommendations, if any, of the arbitral panel; and
the reasonable period of time which is necessary in order to implement the means to resolve the dispute. If the Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time, a Party may request the original arbitral panel to determine
the length of the reasonable period of time, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case. The determination of the arbitral panel shall be presented within fifteen (15) days from that request.
If, in its final report, the arbitral panel determines that a Party has not conformed with its obligations under this Agreement or that a Party's measure has caused nullification or impairment, the means to resolve the dispute shall, whenever possible, be to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.
ARTICLE 20.14 : NON-IMPLEMENTATION  COMPENSATION AND SUSPENSION OF BENEFITS
If the Parties
are unable to agree on the means to resolve the dispute pursuant to paragraph 2(a) of Article 20.13 within thirty (30) days of issuance of the final report; or
have agreed on the means to resolve the dispute pursuant to Article 20.13 and the Party complained against fails to implement the aforesaid means within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the reasonable period of
time determined in accordance with paragraph 2(b) of Article 20.13,

the Party complained against shall enter into negotiations with the complaining Party with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement on any necessary compensatory adjustment.
If no mutually satisfactory agreement on compensation has been reached within twenty (20) days after the Parties have entered into negotiations on compensatory adjustment, the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the Party complained against that it intends to suspend the application to that Party of benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the complaining Party proposes to suspend. The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits thirty (30) days after the date when it provides notice to the Party complained against under this paragraph, or the date when the arbitral panel issues the report under paragraph 6, whichever is later.
Any suspension of benefits shall be restricted to benefits granted to the Party complained against under this Agreement.
In considering what benefits to suspend under paragraph 2:
the complaining Party should first seek to suspend benefits in the same sector or sectors as that affected by the measure or other matter that the arbitral panel has found to be inconsistent with this Agreement or to have caused nullification or impairment; and
the complaining Party may suspend benefits in other sectors if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same sector.
The suspension of benefits shall be temporary and shall only be applied until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with this Agreement, or to have caused nullification or impairment has been removed, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.
If the Party complained against considers that:
the level of benefits that the complaining Party has proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive; or

it has eliminated the non-conformity, nullification or impairment that the arbitral panel has found,
it may request the original arbitral panel to determine the matter. The original arbitral panel shall present its determination to the Parties within thirty (30) days after it reconvenes.
If the arbitral panel cannot be reconvened with its original members, the
procedures for appointment for the arbitral panel set out in Article 20.7 shall be applied. ARTICLE 20.15 : OFFICIAL LANGUAGE
All proceedings and all documents submitted to the arbitral panel shall be in the English language.
When an original document submitted to the arbitral panel by a Party is not in the English language, that Party shall translate it into the English language and submit it with the original document at the same time.
ARTICLE 20.16 : EXPENSES
Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the costs of the arbitral panel and other
expenses associated with the conduct of its proceedings shall be borne in equal parts by both Parties.
Each Party shall bear its own expenses and legal costs in the arbitral proceedings.

ARTICLE 21.1 : DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Chapter:
tax agreement means a convention for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement.
ARTICLE 21.2 : GENERAL EXCEPTIONS
Article XX of GATT is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, for the purposes of:
Chapters 3 (National Treatment and Market Access for Goods), 4 (Rules of Origin), 5 (Customs Procedures), 6 (Trade Remedies), and 14 (Electronic Commerce), except to the extent that a provision of those Chapters applies to services or investment; and
Chapter 16 (Government Procurement), except to the extent that any of its provisions applies to services.
Subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article XIV of GATS are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, for the purposes of:

Chapter 9 (Cross Border Trade in Services);
Chapter 10 (Investment);
Chapters 11 (Telecommunication) and 12 (Financial Services); and
Chapter 16 (Government Procurement), to the extent that a provision applies to services.

ARTICLE 21.3 : NATIONAL SECURITY
1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:
to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or
to prevent a Party from taking any actions which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests:
relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials or relating to the supply     of services as carried on, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of supplying or provisioning a military establishment;
taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations;
relating to fissionable and fusionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; or
to prevent a Party from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.
A Party shall inform the other Party to the fullest extent possible, of measures taken under paragraphs 1(b) and (c) and of their termination during the meeting to review the implementation of this Agreement under Article 22.1, if such measures were taken.
ARTICLE 21.4 : TAXATION
Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the rights and obligations of either Party under any tax agreement to which both Parties are parties. In the event of any

inconsistency between this Agreement and any such agreement, that agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of a bilateral tax agreement between the Parties, the competent authorities under that agreement shall have sole responsibility for determining whether any inconsistency exists between this Agreement and that agreement.
Notwithstanding paragraph 2, Article 3.3 and such other provisions of this Agreement as are necessary to give effect to that Article shall apply to taxation measures to the same extent as does Article III of GATT 1994.
Articles 10.13 and 10.19 shall apply to taxation measures to the extent that such taxation measures constitute expropriation as provided for therein21-1. An investor that seeks to invoke Article 10.13 with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the competent authorities described in paragraph 5, at the time that it gives notice under Article 10.19, the issue of whether that taxation measure involves an expropriation. If the competent authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six
(6) months of such referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 10.19.
For the purposes of this Article, competent authorities means:
21-1 With reference to Article 10.13 in assessing whether a taxation measure constitutes expropriation,
the following considerations are relevant:
the imposition of taxes does not generally constitute expropriation. The mere introduction of new
taxation measures or the imposition of taxes in more than one jurisdiction in respect of an investment,
does not in and of itself constitute expropriation;
taxation measures which are consistent with internationally recognised tax policies, principles and
practices do not constitute expropriation. In particular, taxation measures aimed at preventing the avoidance or evasion of taxes should not, generally, be considered to be expropriatory; and
taxation measures which are applied on a non-discriminatory basis, as opposed to being targeted
at investors of a particular nationality or specific individual taxpayers, are less likely to constitute expropriation. A taxation measure should not constitute expropriation if, when the investment is made, it
was already in force, and information about the measure was made public or otherwise made publicly
available.
